# Absence of Slippage Protection in Direct Mint Calls in MultiplePool.sol

## Summary

Absence of Slippage Protection in Direct Deposit and Mint Function Calls

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the method Multipool#deposit invokes _deposit which in turn calls IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).mint as seen below:

```solidity
IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).mint(
	address(this), //recipient
	position.lowerTick,
	position.upperTick,
	liquidity,
	abi.encode(position.poolFeeAmt)
);
```

This procedure directly mints the liquidity pool (LP) tokens based on the current price in a specific tick range. The referenced method can be found in the official UniswapV3 contract documentation [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolActions.sol#L23).

It is important to note this particular aspect from the UniswapV3 documentation:

> "The caller of this method receives a callback in the form of IUniswapV3MintCallback#uniswapV3MintCallback in which they must pay any token0 or token1 owed for the liquidity. The amount of token0/token1 due depends on tickLower, tickUpper, the amount of liquidity, and the current price."

This approach carries the risk of significant price slippage as it doesn't provide any protection mechanism. Transactions can be delayed or front-run, allowing the price to fluctuate significantly during this period, impacting the final minted amount of LP tokens. 

The lack of an expiration timestamp on the call to IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).mint exacerbates this problem as the transaction can be left pending in the mempool for an extended period, leading to larger price shifts and potentially suboptimal minting of LP tokens.

The calculation of the amount of token0 and token1 paid is directly dependent on the price, as illustrated in the [UniswapV3Pool contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L350C17-L350C17).

## Impact

The absence of slippage protection can lead to a highly suboptimal minting of LP tokens. Additionally, the amounts of token0 and token1 paid to obtain the LP can vary significantly due to price fluctuations and potential front-running tactics.

## Recommendation

It is advised to add liquidity and mint LP tokens via the Uniswap Router, rather than directly invoking the mint method on the pool, to prevent the risk of significant price slippage.
