## Summary
refer to this LOCs: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L722-L746, these LOCs don't allow underflow/overflow, but refering to https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/issues/573 which allows underflow/overflow. This will lead to some transactions will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
some user transactions will revert.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
            if (liquidity > 0) {
                (
                    uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128Pending,
                    uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128Pending
                ) = _getFeeGrowthInside(
                        IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress),
                        slots[i].tick,
                        position.lowerTick,
                        position.upperTick
                    );
                pendingFee0 += uint128(
                    FullMath.mulDiv(
                        feeGrowthInside0X128Pending - feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
                        liquidity,
                        FixedPoint128.Q128
                    )
                );
                pendingFee1 += uint128(
                    FullMath.mulDiv(
                        feeGrowthInside1X128Pending - feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
                        liquidity,
                        FixedPoint128.Q128
                    )
                );
