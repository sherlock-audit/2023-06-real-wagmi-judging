# `_approveToken` that is used in `rebalanceAll` can revert all the time for some ERC20

## Summary
Function `_approveToken` can revert 100% of the time for some ERC20 because of the fact that it approves to 0 if the allowance is greater than 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_approveToken` is used in `rebalanceAll` and verifies first if the allowance of a token is greater than 0 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L933 and then calls the function `approve` on the token with 0 amount https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L195-L203
The problem relies in the cases of ERC20 tokens that revert when the `amount` used in `approve` is 0, tokens like BNB, which is intended to work with the protocol. In the cases of those tokens the rebalancing process would be impossible if the allowance is greater than 0 already since it will revert all the time.
## Impact
The impact is a Medium one since it happens only on some ERC20 and it affects just the `rebalanceAll` function, but even then it will make the rebalance process impossible for those ERC20 tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't try to approve to 0 amount, instead use functions like `decreaseAllowance` from libraries like OpenZeppelin.
