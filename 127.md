# Deposit and withdraw running out of gas

## Summary

The code snippet provided in the report contains a vulnerability that can lead to an unbounded loop and potential out-of-gas issues. The vulnerability exists in the `withdraw` and `deposit` functions of the `Multipool.sol` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 lpAmount,
    uint256 amount0OutMin,
    uint256 amount1OutMin
) external returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) {
    uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();

    (withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1) = _withdraw(lpAmount, _totalSupply);
```

The `withdraw` function calls the following loop:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < posNum; ) {
    position = multiPosition[i];

    {
        (uint128 liquidity, , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).positions(
            position.positionKey
        );
```

The vulnerability arises due to the fact that the number of positions can potentially grow infinitely, leading to a situation where the transaction runs out of gas.

The same issue exists in the `deposit` function, which can also result in an unbounded gas loop.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that both the `withdraw` and `deposit` functions can experience out-of-gas issues, potentially causing transaction failures and preventing users from successfully interacting with the contract.

## Code Snippet

You can find the vulnerable code snippet in the following locations:

- `withdraw` function: [Multipool.sol#L497](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L497)
- `deposit` function: [Multipool.sol#L371](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L371)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a limit on the number of positions and the loop iterations. By enforcing a limit, the contract can prevent unbounded gas loops and ensure that the transactions do not run out of gas.
