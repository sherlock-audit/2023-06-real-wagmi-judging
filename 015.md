# Inadequate Validation of User Input in `Dispatcher.sol` and `Factory.sol`

## Summary

The `Dispatcher.sol` and `Factory.sol` contracts do not sufficiently validate user inputs in a number of areas, which can lead to unexpected reverts and potential issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Dispatcher.sol` and `Factory.sol` contracts contain several methods that require or work with user input but do not adequately validate these inputs.

For instance, in `Dispatcher.sol`, the methods `deposit` and `withdraw` both take an input `pid` but they only check if `pid` is less than `poolInfo.length`. They do not need to check if `pid` is a negative number because Solidity doesn't support negative indices.

Another issue is the `add` function in `Dispatcher.sol` contract which does not validate if the owner, multipool, strategy, token0, and token1 addresses are not zero addresses.

In the `Factory.sol` contract, the `createMultipool` function does not validate if the `manager` address is a smart contract. If the manager is a smart contract, the `MultiStrategy` constructor may fail.

## Impact

This could potentially lead to unexpected behaviours and reverts. Additionally, it could result in the loss of funds if an attacker is able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Dispatcher.sol
function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, uint256 deviationBP) external checkPid(pid) {
  // code omitted
}
```

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, uint256 deviationBP) external checkPid(pid) {
  // code omitted
}
```

```solidity
function add(
  address _owner,
  address _multipool,
  address _strategy,
  address _token0,
  address _token1
) external onlyOwner {
  // code omitted
}
```

```solidity
// Factory.sol
function createMultipool(
  address token0,
  address token1,
  address manager,
  uint24[] memory fees
) external onlyOwner returns (address multipool) {
  // code omitted
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods should be updated to check if `pid` is a non-negative number.
- The `add` function should validate if the owner, multipool, strategy, token0, and token1 addresses are not zero addresses.
- The `createMultipool` function should validate if the `manager` address is a smart contract.

## Proof Of Concept

Call the `add` function in the `Dispatcher.sol` contract and the `createMultipool` function in the `Factory.sol` contract with zero addresses and observe the results.
