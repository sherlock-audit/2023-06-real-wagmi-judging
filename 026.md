# Users can claim more fees than the pool actually holds or get less fees than they are entitled to

## Summary
The _calcFees function does not consider any potential losses that may occur when withdrawing LP tokens from the pool. The estimation of the claimable amount assumes that the LP tokens can be withdrawn without any loss or slippage. In reality, when withdrawing a large amount of LP tokens, there might be price impact and slippage, which can result in lower amounts of token0 and token1 received.
## Vulnerability Detail
when calculating the fees using the formula growth.accPerShare0 - user.feeDebt0 and growth.accPerShare1 - user.feeDebt1. This calculation assumes that the fee growth represents the actual fees accrued by the user. However, it fails to consider potential losses that may occur during rebalancing process, This vulnerability can lead to an incorrect estimation of the fees and result in the user receiving more or fewer fees than they are entitled to. It can potentially be exploited by attackers to manipulate the fee distribution and gain an unfair advantage.
## Impact
When a user performs a withdrawal, the actual amount of LP tokens removed from the pool may differ from the estimated amount. This will result in a loss of funds for the user if the estimated amount was lower than the actual amount required to withdraw their shares.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Modify the _calcFees function to calculate the fees after accounting for potential losses during rebalancing

2. Update the _estimateWithdrawalLp function to take into account the potential losses during rebalancing

3. In the estimateClaim function, pass the additional parameters required for the updated _calcFees and _estimateWithdrawalLp functions:
