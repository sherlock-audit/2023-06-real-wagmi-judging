# Users proportionate share of `fees` may be `lost` forever.

## Summary
The `withdraw` function takes in an input value `amount`, this value is user inputed and it is prone to human error. If a user inputs a value of `amount` greater than his `user.shares` the user will lose their share of fees.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` uses an if statement to run the withdrawal of fees for the user but this is only if the amount is less than `user.shares`. 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, uint256 deviationBP) external checkPid(pid) {
        PoolInfo memory pool = poolInfo[pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[pid][msg.sender];
        (
            uint256 reserve0,
            uint256 reserve1,
            IMultipool.FeeGrowth memory feesGrow,
            uint256 _totalSupply
        ) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).snapshot();

        require(user.shares > 0, "user.shares is 0");
        require(_totalSupply > 0, "sharesTotal is 0");
        if (amount > user.shares) {
            // withdraw witout claiming
            amount = user.shares;
        } else if (amount < user.shares) {
            uint256 lpAmount;
            {
                (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
                lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            }
            user.shares -= lpAmount;
            _withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
        }
//More Code.....
}
```
## Impact
if this occurs, the user's share of fees will be lost forever as `user.shares` is reset  after the If statement.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The logic for sending the fees should be brought out of the if statement so that it can be applied to the two conditions.
