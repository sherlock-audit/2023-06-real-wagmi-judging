# lack of slippage control mechanism for uniswap swapping

## Summary

Contract interact with UNISWAP v3 pool to deposit user deposit and mint the equivalent amount of tokens.
There are not provision to ensure the minimum amount of tokens that would be minted to user.
When there are cap to ensure not to reach the max value but there are not cap to ensure the minimum amount of token that would be minted for user.

## Vulnerability Detail

When we see the `Multipool.sol`, [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L433), it will take the user input such as `amount0Desired`,  `amount1Desired` as inputs and deposit the amount into uniswap pool and mint the equivalent amount of tokens to user.
The actual code lies inside the [_deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L360) where the input amounts are taken and interacted with uniswap pool.

But there are no checks to ensure the minimum amount of tokens are collected during the swap.

## Impact

User would be affected by the sandwich attack or other price manipulation attacks.

## Recommendation

Refactor the [_deposit ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L360-L416)function such that it will take the slippage( min expected amount) as input and meet that value during the swap.
