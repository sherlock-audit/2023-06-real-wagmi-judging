# Slippage amount0Min and amount1Min only applies partially

## Summary

Slippage Protection Partially Applied in Deposit Function

In the context of cryptocurrency transactions, slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. When calling the 'deposit' function in a contract, users have the option to specify a minimum amount for tokens (amount0Min and amount1Min) to protect against such slippage. However, the report reveals that this slippage protection fails to apply when the total supply of tokens is zero, potentially leading to financial losses for users.

## Vulnerability Detail

While executing the `deposit` function, a user can use `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` for slippage protection:

```solidity
function deposit(
    uint256 amount0Desired,
    uint256 amount1Desired,
    uint256 amount0Min,
    uint256 amount1Min
) external returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
```
However, when the total supply is null, these slippage protections (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min`) fail to apply as observed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L447).

In case the total supply is not null, the `_optimizeAmounts` function is called, where slippage protections are only checked conditionally:

```solidity
(amount0Desired, amount1Desired) = _optimizeAmounts(
    amount0Desired,
    amount1Desired,
    amount0Min,
    amount1Min,
    reserve0,
    reserve1
);
```
This is a potential flaw as, during the deposit and minting operation, `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` values are derived from the price and ticker range.

```solidity
  function _optimizeAmounts(
        uint256 amount0Desired,
        uint256 amount1Desired,
        uint256 amount0Min,
        uint256 amount1Min,
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1
    ) private pure returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        if (reserve0 == 0 && reserve1 == 0) {
            (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Desired, amount1Desired);
        } else {
            uint256 amount1Optimal = _quote(amount0Desired, reserve0, reserve1);
            if (amount1Optimal <= amount1Desired) {
                ErrLib.requirement(
                    amount1Optimal >= amount1Min,
                    ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_1_AMOUNT
                );
                (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Desired, amount1Optimal);
            } else {
                uint256 amount0Optimal = _quote(amount1Desired, reserve1, reserve0);
                assert(amount0Optimal <= amount0Desired);
                ErrLib.requirement(
                    amount0Optimal >= amount0Min,
                    ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_0_AMOUNT
                );
                (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Optimal, amount1Desired);
            }
        }
    }
```

Slippage amount0Min and amount1Min only applies partially and conditionally but both amount0Min and amount1Min should be applied

## Impact

This incomplete application of slippage protection can lead to loss of funds as it fails to fully secure the user's deposits.

## Code Snippet

The problematic code can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L447) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L459).

## Recommendation

It's suggested to apply `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` slippage protection fully, and calculate the token0 and token1 amounts used when minting positions. This can help in avoiding losses that can occur due to price fluctuations.
