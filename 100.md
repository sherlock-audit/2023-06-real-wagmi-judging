# Insufficient lpAmount Validation Could Lead to Stuck Funds During Significant Price Movements.

## Summary
The vulnerability is caused by the possibility of the estimated `lpAmount` being greater than or equal to the user's shares due to significant price movements, which could lead to users' funds being stuck and inaccessible.


## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises when estimating the `lpAmount` using the `_estimateWithdrawalLp` function in both the `withdraw` and `deposit` functions. The calculated `lpAmount` is then used to update the user's shares. However, if a significant price movement occurs, there is no guarantee that the `lpAmount` will always be less than the user's shares.

If the `lpAmount` is greater than or equal to the user's shares, users' funds may become stuck and inaccessible. This issue is especially concerning during extreme market fluctuations when users might need to withdraw their funds urgently.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it could prevent users from withdrawing or depositing their funds during significant price movements. Moreover, it could lead to a loss of funds for affected users.

## Code Snippet

In the withdraw function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L234
```solidity
{
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
}
user.shares -= lpAmount;
```
In the deposit function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L193

```solidity
{
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
}
user.shares -= lpAmount;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Modify the `_estimateWithdrawalLp` function to account for price movements by adding a `priceFactor` parameter.
```solidity
function _estimateWithdrawalLp(
    uint256 reserve0,
    uint256 reserve1,
    uint256 _totalSupply,
    uint256 amount0,
    uint256 amount1,
    uint256 priceFactor
) private pure returns (uint256 shareAmount) {
    shareAmount =
        ((amount0 * _totalSupply) / (reserve0 * priceFactor) + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1) /
        2;
}
```
2. Update the `withdraw` and `deposit` functions to include the `priceFactor` when calling `_estimateWithdrawalLp`.
```solidity
// In the withdraw function:
{
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1, priceFactor);
}

// In the deposit function:
{
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1, priceFactor);
}
```
3. In both the `withdraw` and `deposit` functions, add a loop to adjust the `priceFactor` until a valid `lpAmount` is found, ensuring that users can withdraw their funds even in cases of extreme market fluctuations.
```solidity
// In the withdraw function:
uint256 priceFactor = 1;
while (lpAmount >= user.shares) {
    priceFactor++;
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1, priceFactor);
}

// In the deposit function:
uint256 priceFactor = 1;
while (lpAmount >= user.shares) {
    priceFactor++;
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1, priceFactor);
}
```
this will allow users to withdraw their funds even in cases of extreme market fluctuations.
