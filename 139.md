# Predictability of multipool address can DOS the Factory::createMultipool function

## Summary
There is a scenario in which the `address` of the `multipool` can be predicted and overtaken by a malicious user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Factory::createMultipool function is responsible for creating new `Multipools`. It does this using the `create2` opcode.

## Impact
A malicious user can detect the owner's `createMultipool` transaction from the mempool and reuse the same `token0` and `token1` to calculate the salt. Subsequently, this malicious user can front-run the owner's transaction and occupy the calculated addresses. As a result, the creation of the multipool for the corresponding pair of tokens will be deterred.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `msg.sender` in the compilation of the salt.
