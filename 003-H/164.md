# Factory.getQuoteAtTick() calculates the latest quote at a given tick, instead of a quote at an arbitrary tick

## Summary

getQuoteAtTick() does not give the quote amount back at a given tick, but rather gives the quote amount back at the latest tick, which is not the supposed use of the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getQuoteAtTick()` is supposed to calculate the amount of token received in exchange given a tick and a token amount in the original UniswapV3 code. 

```solidity
    /// @notice Given a tick and a token amount, calculates the amount of token received in exchange
    /// @param tick Tick value used to calculate the quote
    /// @param baseAmount Amount of token to be converted
    /// @param baseToken Address of an ERC20 token contract used as the baseAmount denomination
    /// @param quoteToken Address of an ERC20 token contract used as the quoteAmount denomination
    /// @return quoteAmount Amount of quoteToken received for baseAmount of baseToken
    function getQuoteAtTick(
@>      int24 tick,
        uint128 baseAmount,
        address baseToken,
        address quoteToken
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 quoteAmount) {
@>      uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tick);


        // Calculate quoteAmount with better precision if it doesn't overflow when multiplied by itself
        if (sqrtRatioX96 <= type(uint128).max) {
```

Note that the input parameter has a `tick` and the `sqrtRatioX96` variable is calculated with the TickMath library, with the input of tick. At any `tick` value, the quote amount can be calculated. 

However, this protocol uses getQuoteAtTick differently. The tick value is not an input, but rather taken from slot0. sqrtPriceX96 is not calculated using the tick value through TickMath, but rather taken from the current price of the pool (as a sqrt(token1/token0) Q64.96 value). **This means that the function always uses the latest tick value**. (The current tick of the pool, i.e. according to the last tick transition that was run. This value may not always be equal to SqrtTickMath getTickAtSqrtRatio(sqrtPriceX96) if the price is on a tick boundary.)

```solidity
    function getQuoteAtTick(
        uint24 poolFee,
        uint128 amountIn,
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut
    ) external view returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        address multipool = getmultipool(tokenIn, tokenOut);
        require(multipool != address(0), "pool not found");
        address underlyingPool = IMultipool(multipool).underlyingTrustedPools(poolFee).poolAddress;


@>      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingPool).slot0();


        if (sqrtPriceX96 <= type(uint128).max) {
```


## Impact

`getQuoteAtTick` always returns the quote from the latest tick, instead of an arbitrary input tick value.
