# liquidity is exteremly easy to manipulate due to how the multipool calculates its reserves

## Summary
Multipool#getTotalAmounts uses the UniV3Pool.slot0 to determine the number of tokens it has in it's position. slot0 is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate. Given that the protocol specializes in leverage, the effects of this manipulation would compound to make malicious uses even easier.
## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit function uses the slots to calculate it's reserves.
```solidity
            slots = getSlots();
            (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, , ) = _getReserves(slots);
            (amount0Desired, amount1Desired) = _optimizeAmounts(
                amount0Desired,
                amount1Desired,
                amount0Min,
                amount1Min,
                reserve0,
                reserve1
            );
     // ---- more code ----
            liquidity = _calcLiquidityAmountToDeposit(
                slots[i].currentSqrtRatioX96,
                position,
                amount0Desired,
                amount1Desired
            );
```
In the getSlot function you can see how it gets it values.
```solidity
 (slots[i].currentSqrtRatioX96, slots[i].tick, , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(
                position.poolAddress
            ).slot0();
```
the liquidity calsulated using the currentSqrtRatioX96,, which is gotten from UniV3Pool.slot0
```solidity
   function _calcLiquidityAmountToDeposit(
        uint160 currentSqrtRatioX96,
        PositionInfo memory position,
        uint256 amount0Desired,
        uint256 amount1Desired
    ) private pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {
    //@audit look into this.
        liquidity = LiquidityAmounts.getLiquidityForAmounts(
            currentSqrtRatioX96,
            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(position.lowerTick),
            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(position.upperTick),
            (amount0Desired * position.weight) / MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256,
            (amount1Desired * position.weight) / MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256
        );
    }
```
the getSlot uses the UniV3Pool.slot0 to determine the number of tokens it has in its position. [slot0](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0) is the most recent data point and can easily be manipulated.

The amount0Desired, and amount1Desired are then calculated using the reserves, Also the Liquidity is calculated using the currentSqrtRatioX96, gotten from slot),  this allows a malicious user to manipulate the valuation of the LP. An example of this kind of manipulation would be to use large buys/sells to alter the composition of the LP to make it worth less or more.
## Impact
LP value can be manipulated to cause loss of funds for the protocol and other users, This allows a malicious user to manipulate the valuation of the LP. An example of this kind of manipulation would be to use large buys/sells to alter the composition of the LP to make it worth less or more.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Token balances/reserves should be calculated inside the prices. To determine the liquidity, use a TWAP instead of slot0.
