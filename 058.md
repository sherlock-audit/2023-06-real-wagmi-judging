# DoS possible with createMultipool() creation in Factory.sol

## Summary
DoS possible with createMultipool creation in Factory.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In Factory.sol contract, Multipools are created using createMultipool ()  function which is given as below,

```Solidity
File: concentrator/contracts/Factory.sol

76    function createMultipool(
77        address token0,
78       address token1,
79        address manager,
80        uint24[] memory fees
81    ) external onlyOwner returns (address multipool) {
82        require(manager != address(0), "manager is zero address");
83        require(getmultipool(token0, token1) == address(0), "already created");
84        (token0, token1) = _validateTokens(token0, token1);

           // some code

92        string memory _name = string.concat("Wagmi LP ", tokens);
93        string memory _symbol = string.concat(tokens, " WLP");
94        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1));
95
96        MultiStrategy strategy = new MultiStrategy{ salt: salt }(token0, token1, manager);
97        bytes memory bytecode = multipoolCode.getMultipoolCode();

           // some code
```

As seen above, at L-94. It has used salt while creating the Multipool, This means that a malicious actor can prevent a user/owner from deploying Multipool creation by frontrunning it with the **same "salt".**

**Additionally, This protocol is also being deployed on Multichains like Arbitrum, polygon so additional and more-critical vulnerabilities become possible via reorg attacks.**

**Proof of Concept:**

The "salt" is a bytes32 value that is used in Multipool creation call by the caller/owner. This enables frontrunning to occur in the following way:

1. An attacker monitors the mempool for pending transactions that involve cloning a contract with a provided "salt".
2. Upon spotting such a transaction, the attacker extracts the "salt" value.
3. The attacker quickly submits their own transaction with a higher gas price, attempting to clone the contract with the same "salt" before the original transaction is mined.
4. If the transaction got successful, the attacker's transaction is mined first, and the contract clone is created at the expected address.
5. The original transaction will likely fail, as the contract with the expected address has already been deployed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a salt that includes the msg.sender. That way it is not possible to front-run the transaction.

```Solidity

-        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1));
+       bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1, msg.sender));

        MultiStrategy strategy = new MultiStrategy{ salt: salt }(token0, token1, manager);
```
