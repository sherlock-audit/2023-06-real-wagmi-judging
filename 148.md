# Factory contract does not support all ERC20 tokens, breaking core protocol requirement

## Summary

The ERC20 standard does not require that the `symbol` function is implemented. However, the implementation of the Factory contract requires this to be the case, meaning not all tokens will be able to be used to create pools, breaking requirements

## Vulnerability Detail

As per the specifications for the ERC20 token standard, the `symbol` and `name` functions are optional, meaning in order to support all ERC20 tokens, you cannot assume that these functions will be implemented. This can be seen here: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20. However, in the factory contract, the `createMultipool` function explicitly calls the `symbol` function for all ERC20 tokens:
```solidity
string memory tokens = string.concat(
    IERC20Metadata(token0).symbol(),
    "/",
    IERC20Metadata(token1).symbol()
);
```
In the case that this function does not exist for that ERC20 token, this call will revert, and the Factory contract will not be able to create any pool which contains that token. This means that pools cannot be created for all ERC20 tokens, breaking this core protocol requirement laid out in the audit specifications.

## Impact

This prevents the creation of certain pools which contains tokens which don't implement the optional `symbol` function, breaking this core protocol requirement

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either use a try-catch statement to call the `symbol` function, utilize a string version of the token address, or explicitly pass in string arguments representing the names of both tokens in the `createMultipool` function.
