# The XAUT token isn't compatible with the system and won't work properly in a multipool

## Summary
The XAUT token always returns false upon transferring tokens, no matter if the operation fails or not. This will always lead to the internal transferring functions triggering a revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Tether Gold (XAUT) token always returns false upon transferring tokens, no matter if the operation fails or not. This will always lead to the internal **`_safeTransfer`**, **`_safeTransferFrom`** and **`_safeApprove`** functions to trigger a revert, because of the output boolean check.

    // @audit Will always fail here:
    ErrLib.requirement(
		success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
		ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_FROM_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
	);

## Impact
The XAUT token isn't going to be able to be used in a protocol multipool.
