# Uniswap3 TWAP price may be manipulated

## Summary

In wagmi, the price calculation depends on the price of uniswap3 slot. The problem is that this price can be [manipulated](https:blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3-oracles) in POS

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        reserve0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        reserve1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 posNum = multiPosition.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < posNum; ) {
            // ...

            (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(
                slots[i].currentSqrtRatioX96,
                TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(position.lowerTick),
                TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(position.upperTick),
                liquidity
            );
            reserve0 += amount0;
            reserve1 += amount1;

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
Reverse has two manipulation methods. One is to transfer tokens directly to this contract, which cannot get tokens back, will cause direct losses, and there is a check `lpAmount > 0`, cannot achieve the effect of ERC4626 vault first deposit attack.  
The second is to manipulate the slot price of uniswap pool, which is instantaneous and has no funds loss. When reverse is maliciously manipulated to increase, the other amounts remain the same, and the user mint's lpAmount decreases. 
In this way, when withdraw occurs, other users account for a larger proportion than the attacked user, so they can withdraw more funds.  
```solidity
            // MINIMUM
            uint256 l0 = (amount0Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve0;
            uint256 l1 = (amount1Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve1;
            lpAmount = l0 < l1 ? l0 : l1;
        }

        ErrLib.requirement(lpAmount > 0, ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_MINTED);
        ErrLib.requirement(
            maxTotalSupply >= _totalSupply + lpAmount,
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.MAX_TOTAL_SUPPLY_REACHED
        );
        _pay(token0, msg.sender, address(this), amount0Desired);
        _pay(token1, msg.sender, address(this), amount1Desired);

        _deposit(amount0Desired, amount1Desired, _totalSupply, slots);

        _mint(msg.sender, lpAmount);
```
Assume:
1. UserA deposit 100 tokenA and tokenB, mint lpAmount = 100
2. The pos proposer increase the slot price
3. UserB deposit 100 tokenA and tokenB, mint lpAmount = 50
4. When withdrawing, user A can withdraw 132, while user B can only withdraw 66

## Impact

The slot0 price affects the calculation of reverse and indirectly affects the amount of deposit and withdraw, resulting in the loss of funds for users
