# Vulnerability to Front-Running Attacks in Liquidity Provision Function

## Summary

Upon thorough examination of the provided smart contract, it was found that the `_optimizeAmounts` and `_quote` functions in the contract might be susceptible to front-running attacks due to inadequate slippage control mechanisms.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `_optimizeAmounts` and `_quote` functions are designed to determine the optimal amount of tokens to be added to a Uniswap V3 position. Currently, the slippage control in place only requires the ratio of token0 and token1 to remain roughly the same during a transaction.

However, this strategy does not consider scenarios where the contract balances of the vault and one or more underlying positions can be manipulated by a sophisticated attacker,there is a possibility for the ratios of one of these positions/vault balance to go up, but another one to go down, and end up with the same overall ratio.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can force victims to mint at an inflated share price (High-value tokens may be undervalued due to their proportion in the pool, got lower liquidity back), which results in the victim receiving fewer shares than expected. The attacker can then profit by burning their shares to take a portion of the funds contributed to the vault by the victim.

PoC 

### Given:

- Pool: USDC / WETH
- Current ETH price: 2,000 USDC / ETH
- RealWagmi totalSupply: 8.0
- Attacker's RealWagmi shares: 7.0 (The attacker holds 87.5% of the totalSupply)
- RealWagmi's underlying assets:
  - RealWagmi contract balance:
    - usdc: 0.0
    - eth: 2.0
  - In the uniswap v3 pool:
    - usdc: 2000.0
    - eth: 0.0
- Total value: 2000.0 + 2.0 * 2,000 = $6,000
- Attacker's funds:
  - RealWagmi shares: 7.0
  - usdc: 4000.0
  - eth: 0.0
- Total value: 4000 + (6,000 * 7 / 8) = $9,250 (including the balances of RealWagmi contract)
- Victim's funds:
  - usdc: 4,000.0
  - eth: 4.0
- Total value: 4,000 + 4.0 * 2,000 = $12,000

### When:

- The attacker front runs the victim's deposit() transaction:
  - Attacker transfers 4,000 USDC to the RealWagmi contract
  - Attacker manipulates uniswapv3Pool.slot0's sqrtPriceX96 (swap ETH to USDC)
  - Victim calls deposit({amount0Desired: 4000, amount1Desired: 4, amount0Min: 4000, amount1Min: 4})
  - RealWagmi _getReserves() (using the manipulated price):
    - RealWagmi contract balance:
      - usdc: 4000.0
      - eth: 2.0
    - In uniswap v3 pool:
      - usdc: 0.0
      - eth: 2.0
- RealWagmi totalSupply: 8.0 -> 16.0
    - RealWagmi's underlying assets:
        - usdc + 4000
        - eth 
    - In uniswap v3 pool:
      - usdc: 0.0
      - eth: 2 + 4
- Attacker reverses uniswapv3Pool.slot0's sqrtPriceX96 back to the original price (swap USDC back to ETH)
- Attacker calls `withdraw()` 7 lpAmount
- RealWagmi totalSupply: 16.0 -> 9.0
- RealWagmi _getReserves():
  - RealWagmi contract balance:
    - usdc: 8000.0
    - eth: 2
  - In the uniswap v3 pool:
    - usdc: 6000.0
    - eth: 0.0
  - Total:
    - usdc: 8000.0 + 6000.0 = 14,000.0
    - eth: 2
    

This vulnerability could  lead to financial losses for users.

```solidity=780
function _optimizeAmounts(
    uint256 amount0Desired,
    uint256 amount1Desired,
    uint256 amount0Min,
    uint256 amount1Min,
    uint256 reserve0,
    uint256 reserve1
) private pure returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
    if (reserve0 == 0 && reserve1 == 0) {
        (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Desired, amount1Desired);
    } else {
        uint256 amount1Optimal = _quote(amount0Desired, reserve0, reserve1);
        if (amount1Optimal <= amount1Desired) {
            ErrLib.requirement(
                amount1Optimal >= amount1Min,
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_1_AMOUNT
            );
            (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Desired, amount1Optimal);
        } else {
            uint256 amount0Optimal = _quote(amount1Desired, reserve1, reserve0);
            assert(amount0Optimal <= amount0Desired);
            ErrLib.requirement(
                amount0Optimal >= amount0Min,
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_0_AMOUNT
            );
            (amount0, amount1) = (amount0Optimal, amount1Desired);
        }
    }
}

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Developers should improve the slippage control mechanism in these functions to guard against potential front-running attacks. This might include setting additional parameters such as minShares, maxToken0, and maxToken1 to provide more precise control over the execution price of the trades.
