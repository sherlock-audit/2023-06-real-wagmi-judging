# Using only 150 blocks as `twapDuration` is very easily to manipulate in low volume pools

## Summary
Using only 150 blocks as `twapDuration` is very easy to manipulate in low volume pools 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `getAmountOut` there is hardcoded `150` as the twapDuration. This does mean that 
it returns the cumulative tick and liquidity as of each timestamp secondsAgo from the current block timestamp.

So it returns the TWAP `tickCumulatives` of the last 150 seconds.

Due to real wagmi deploying in a lot to secondary chains like kava and wanting to integrate with a wide variety of pools, the 150 seconds `observe` call is extreamily prone to manipulation. Specially in pools were there are no transactions in 2 minutes (pretty much more than 50% outside ethereum)

Attacker will be able to manipulate the `tickCumulatives` to affect to the amount of slippage expected during rebalances, accepting much more slippage than the contract should, losing funds.

## Impact
Loss of funds due to accepting a much higher amount of slippage because of manipulation

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase the TWAP duration to around a (1000)  to get an appropiate and correct exchange rate
