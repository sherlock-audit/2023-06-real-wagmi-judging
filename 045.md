# The `deposit` function in the `Multipool.sol` requires a minimum amount which can be too much for some ERC20 tokens

## Summary
The `deposit` function verifies that the `amount0Desired` and `amount1Desired` is greater than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` which is hardcoded to 1e6. Because of that in some cases this amount can be too much for most of the people to deposit and interact with the project.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `deposit` has this check at the beginning https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L440-L443 where `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` is hardcoded to 1e6 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L74 
Take the simple case of WBTC, a wrapped token that the project specified is interacting with. WBTC has 8 decimals which means that the minimum amount a person would need to deposit in any WBTC pool is 1% of the total value of a Bitcoin. As the moment of writing this Bitcoin is around 30.000$ which means that the minimum amount to be deposited is around 300$ dollars worth of WBTC, which is a lot for most people. Also consider the fact of another bull run where bitcoin can get close to ATH of ~65.000$, meaning that the minimum amount would need to be around 650$, making the project unusable for most people because of the high values.
## Impact
The impact is a Medium one since it happens only on WBTC, but Multipools that have WBTC would be too costly for most of the people to interact of use.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` to something lower or take special care for WBTC since the project specifies that is interacting with WBTC too
