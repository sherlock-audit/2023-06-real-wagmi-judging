# `estimateWithdrawalAmounts()` can throw unexpected results due to `_totalSupply` not checked for `0` value.


## Summary
The `estimateWithdrawalAmounts` function is responsible for calculating the amounts of `token0` and `token1` to be withdrawn from a liquidity pool based on the provided `lpAmount` of LP tokens. However, if the `_totalSupply` of LP tokens is zero, the current implementation would cause a division by zero error during the calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail

If `_totalSupply` is zero, it will cause a division by zero error when calculating the withdrawal amounts in the `estimateWithdrawalAmounts` function. The division operation `(reserve0 * lpAmount) / _totalSupply` and `(reserve1 * lpAmount) / _totalSupply` would result in an exception, leading to a runtime error.


## Impact

The division by zero issue in the `estimateWithdrawalAmounts` function can lead to runtime errors, inconsistent results, potential financial losses for users, unpredictable user experience, and security risks. Resolving this issue is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of the function, maintain accuracy in withdrawal calculations, and provide a secure and reliable environment for liquidity pool operations.

```solidity
function estimateWithdrawalAmounts(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 lpAmount
) external view returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
    address multipool = getmultipool(tokenA, tokenB);
    require(multipool != address(0), "pool not found");
    uint256 _totalSupply = IERC20(multipool).totalSupply();
    (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, , ) = IMultipool(multipool).getReserves();
    amount0 = (reserve0 * lpAmount) / _totalSupply;
    amount1 = (reserve1 * lpAmount) / _totalSupply;
  
}
```

## Recommendation

Implement Conditional Statement to check if `_totalSupply > 0` .
