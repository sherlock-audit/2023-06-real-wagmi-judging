# User's share is withdrawn twice instead of once

## Summary
When the amount is greater than the user's shares, the user's share will be withdrawn twice: once when amount is set to user.shares, and again when sharesRemoved is deducted from user.shares. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises when the amount parameter is less than user.shares. In this case, the code calculates lpAmount using the _estimateWithdrawalLp function, and then subtracts lpAmount from user.shares. However, later in the code, sharesRemoved is calculated as the minimum value between amount and user.shares, and then subtracted from user.shares again.
This means that when amount is less than user.shares, the user's share will be withdrawn twice: once when amount is set to user.shares, and again when sharesRemoved is deducted from user.shares. 
## Impact
The user will end up with a negative share balance due to his share is withdrawn twice, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The second subtraction of sharesRemoved from user.shares should be removed. With this modification, the user's shares will only be subtracted once, ensuring that the share balance remains accurate and preventing potential loss of funds
