# Improper validation of `create2` return value

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deploy()` function in the Factory contract is used to deploy a multipool contract via the `CREATE2` opcode. The function does not revert properly if there is a failed contract deployment or revert from the `CREATE2` opcode as it does not correctly check the returned address for bytecode. The `CREATE2` opcode returns the expected address which will never be the zero address (as is what is currently checked).

## Impact
By the addition of CREATE2 in [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) with the Constantinople hard fork, the contract deployment model changed to 4 states:
"not yet deployed", "deployed", "self-destructed", and "redeployed".
It means that the contract can be re-deployed to another bytecode using the CREATE2 opcode. This opens situations to Metamorphic Contract attacks. This means that one can redeploy different bytecodes on a specific address multiple times as the mentioned opcode contains `0xFF` as its primary argument. By not checking the code size of the returned address, there would exist such vulnerabilities.

## Recommendation
Consider checking the `extcodesize()` of the `contractAddress` not to be zero rather than the address itself
