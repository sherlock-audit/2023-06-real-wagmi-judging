# Uniswap V3 not presented on some L2s

## Summary

Uniswap V3 is not presented on some L2s

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol expected to be deployed on several L2s: Fantom, Arbitrum, ZKera, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, KAVA.
However, Uniswap V3 is not presented on Fantom, ZKera, KAVA:
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments
This means protocol would be fully broken on these chains.

## Impact

Protocol would not work on some L2s.
