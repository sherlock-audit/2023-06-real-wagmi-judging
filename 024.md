# Incorrect Fee Calculation Leading to Loss of Funds

## Summary

The `_withdraw` function in Multipool.sol contains a vulnerability related to incorrect fee calculation, which can lead to various undesirable consequences such as loss of funds, inaccurate accounting, contract instability, and user dissatisfaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability resides in the calculation of fees related to token amounts owed. The function iterates through multiple positions and performs fee calculations based on liquidity amounts and owed tokens. However, there are scenarios where the fee calculation logic may produce incorrect results, leading to potential financial and operational risks.

### Consider the Below Scenario:

#### Initial state:

- Token 0 owed before: 100 tokens
- Token 1 owed before: 100 tokens

During the execution of the _withdraw function, let's assume the following happens:

- The liquidity value retrieved from the Uniswap V3 pool is 100.
- The liquidityToWithdraw value calculated based on the lpAmount and _totalSupply is 50.

The burn function is called with the position details and liquidityToWithdraw, resulting in:

- amount0 (withdrawn amount of token 0): 40 tokens
- amount1 (withdrawn amount of token 1): 40 tokens

After the withdrawal, the updated owed amounts for tokens 0 and 1 are:

- Token 0 owed after: 60 tokens
- Token 1 owed after: 60 tokens

Calculating the fees:

- fee0 (fee for token 0):
`(tokensOwed0After - amount0) - tokensOwed0Before = (60 - 40) - 100 = -80 tokens`
- fee1 (fee for token 1):
`(tokensOwed1After - amount1) - tokensOwed1Before = (60 - 40) - 100 = -80 tokens`

In this simulated scenario, the fee calculation results in negative values for both fee0 and fee1. This suggests that there might be an issue with the fee calculation logic, as negative fees are unexpected. Further investigation and analysis of the contract's logic and the specific calculations being performed would be required to identify and address the root cause of this issue.

## Impact

1. Loss of funds: Incorrect fee calculation may result in funds being distributed incorrectly or not distributed at all, leading to financial losses for the contract owner or participants.
2. Inaccurate accounting: Wrong fee calculation can cause inaccuracies in financial data, such as balance tracking, profit calculation, or fee distribution records, which may lead to misleading reporting and analysis.
3. Contract instability: The incorrect fee calculation can destabilize the contract's operation, causing unexpected behavior, inconsistencies, or even contract failures if fees play a critical role in its functionality.
4. User dissatisfaction: Users who expected fair and accurate fee distribution may be dissatisfied with the contract if they encounter incorrect fee calculations. This can erode trust and negatively impact the overall user experience.
