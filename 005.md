# XO-`Dispatcher` contract have issues can break `core` functionality of `protocol`

## Summary
-  The withdraw function does not check to make sure that the amount being withdrawn is less than or equal to the amount of LP tokens that can allows an attacker to withdraw more LP tokens than they are entitled to. This is `becauseattacker` is entitled to. 
## Vulnerability Detail
- The Dispatcher contract has a vulnerability  in the withdraw function : 
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, uint256 deviationBP) external checkPid(pid) {
        PoolInfo memory pool = poolInfo[pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[pid][msg.sender];
        (
            uint256 reserve0,
            uint256 reserve1,
            IMultipool.FeeGrowth memory feesGrow,
            uint256 _totalSupply
        ) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).snapshot();

        require(user.shares > 0, "user.shares is 0");
        require(_totalSupply > 0, "sharesTotal is 0");
        if (amount > user.shares) {
            // withdraw witout claiming
            amount = user.shares;
        } else if (amount < user.shares) {
            uint256 lpAmount;
            {
                (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
                lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            }
            user.shares -= lpAmount;
            _withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
        }

        uint256 sharesRemoved = amount > user.shares ? user.shares : amount;
        user.shares -= sharesRemoved;

        user.feeDebt0 = feesGrow.accPerShare0;
        user.feeDebt1 = feesGrow.accPerShare1;
        _pay(pool.multipool, address(this), msg.sender, sharesRemoved);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, pid, amount);
    }
}
```
- the problem is in the `uint256 sharesRemoved = amount > user.shares ? user.shares : amount;` this line 
if an attacker exploit this issue it's can  withdraw more `LP` tokens than they are entitled to. as an examlpe
 if the attacker has `100 LP`  tokens and they want to withdraw `50 LP` tokens, the line of code would set sharesRemoved to `100`. This means that the attacker would be able to withdraw `100 LP` tokens, even though they are only entitled to withdraw `50 LP` tokens.

## Impact
- this vulnerability can result in a material loss of funds for the victim. an attacker could withdraw more LP tokens than they are entitled to, and the victim would be unable to get their LP tokens back.
- this an example: 
    - Create a new Dispatcher contract.
    - Deposit 100 LP tokens into the contract.
    - Call the withdraw function with an amount of 50 LP tokens.
    - The attacker will be able to withdraw 100 LP tokens, even though they are only entitled to withdraw 50 LP tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- this can fix this problem` uint256 sharesRemoved = amount <= user.shares ? amount : user.shares;` this  will ensure that `sharesRemoved` is always less than or equal to `user.shares,` which will prevent the attacker from withdrawing more `LP` tokens than they are entitled to.
