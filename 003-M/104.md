# Multipool.sol - Too small value used for fees

## Summary

In the `Multipool.sol` contract, we declare the fees as `uint24` and map them to their corresponding pool:
```solidity
uint24[] public fees;
// some declared variables...
//      fee =>poolAddress
mapping(uint24 => UnderlyingPool) public underlyingTrustedPools;
```
However, it's important to note that the maximum value of `uint24` might be too small for certain use cases or scenarios.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `uint24` maximum value is 16,777,215. However, this value might turn out to be too small in certain cases, especially considering that the pool will work with tokens that have at least 1e18 decimal places. 

For perspective: (16,777,215 / 1e18) * 100 = ~0.00000000167773%

For example, USDT on BSC has 18 decimals and the maximum fee you will able to use is ~0.00000000167773% of 1 USDT.

## Impact

The protocol may face challenges in collecting an appropriate amount of fees, particularly for tokens with a high number of decimal places.

## Recommendation

Use a size variable bigger than `uint24`, for example `uint64`.
