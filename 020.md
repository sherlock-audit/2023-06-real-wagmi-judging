# Hardcoded fee in Multipool Leading to Rebalance Failure

## Summary
In the Multipool contract, there is a public function ```getAmountOut``` which  is also called in the ```rebalanceAll``` function. This function retrieves a Uniswap UnderlyingPool address from the underlyingTrustedPools, but there is a hard coded value in this function
```solidity
  function getAmountOut(
        bool zeroForOne,
        uint256 amountIn
    ) public view returns (uint256 swappedOut) {
        uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
        secondsAgo[0] = twapDuration;
        secondsAgo[1] = 0;
        //@audit-issue hardcoded fee at 500 
        (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[500].poolAddress)
            .observe(secondsAgo);
```
## Vulnerability Detail
In the above example, we see that the value at 500 is hardcoded.
## Impact
If for any Multipool, the poolFee of 500 has not been set, address(0)would be passed into this function which can DOS the rebalance function
```solidity
        uint256 swappedOut = getAmountOut(params.zeroForOne, amountIn);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since all created underlyingTrustedPools[_fee].poolAddress are by default set to the ```underlyingV3Factory```  from the constructor   and ```function addUnderlyingPool``` , then the factory address should be passed in directly.
