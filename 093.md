# The rebalanceAll function fails due to missing pool with 0.05% fee

## Summary

When the operator calls the `rebalanceAll` function in Multipool, the function will try to get the estimated amount of `swappedOut` that will be received using TWAP Oracle in the 0.05% fee pool. However, if the token pairs have no 0.05% fee pool, the function will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the rebalanceAll function, when it reaches the swapping part, it will call the `getAmountOut` function to estimate the amount of `swappedOut`. The getAmountOut function gets the price by using TWAP Oracle in the 0.05% fee pool.

        (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[500].poolAddress)
            .observe(secondsAgo);

However, if the token pairs have no 0.05% fee pool, the function will revert. Given that the protocol is deployed in many chains (and new chains) such as Fantom, Arbitrum, ZKera, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, KAVA, the probabilities of a pairs have no 0.05% fee pool is higher.

For example, in Arbitrum at 25 June 2023, one of the most top TVL pools is ETH/GMX 1%: https://info.uniswap.org/pairs#/arbitrum/pools/0x80a9ae39310abf666a87c743d6ebbd0e8c42158e
The ETH/GMX pairs only have pools at 0.3% and 1% tier. This prevents the rebalanceAll function from working.

In other cases, even when the pools at 0.05% fee tier exist for other tokens, if the liquidity of the pool is low, it can be subjected to manipulation.

## Impact

The rebalanceAll function will be reverted if no pool at 0.05% fee exists or the swappedOut amount in the swap can be manipulated due to low liquidity.
The rebalanceAll function will fail if no pool at 0.05% fee exists or the swappedOut amount in the swap can be distorted due to low liquidity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not hardcode the pool at `0.05%`, let operator set it in the `RebalanceParams`

```diff
-    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[500].poolAddress)
+    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[feeTier].poolAddress)
```
