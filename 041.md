# `maxTotalSupply` is set to 1e20 which can be too low considering a pool with two 18 decimals token

## Summary
The `deposit` function in the `Multipool.sol` verify that the `lpAmount` + `_totalSupply` is less or equal than `maxTotalSupply` which is hardcoded to 1e20 and in the cases of a pool with two 18 decimals tokens, `_totalSupply` can get to `maxTotalSupply` very fast making it unusable until some tokens are burned.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider for example a pool on the Uniswap with two stable coins which has 18 decimals both, a good example here is the USDC/USDT pool on Binance Smart Chain or USDT/BUSD on Binance Smart Chain where both stable coins has 18 decimals. Because of the hardcoded `maxTotalSupply` to 1e20, it means that a Multipool that is created for those Uniswap pool, could only deposit 100$ worth of assets, since depositing more than 100$ in would not pass the require statement https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L474-L477 
The amount of 100$ to the whole Multipool is very low and can be easily reached even when the first deposit is made by the owner, making the Multipool unusable most of the time.
## Impact
The impact is a Medium one since it happens only on some specific Uniswap Pools but it needs to be taken care of since the project specifies that it interact will all of the tokens and the chains that I specified above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `maxTotalSupply` to something bigger than 1e20 or take special care for those cases a pool value of only 100$ is way too low
