# Approval to swapTarget is not reset at the end of ```rebalanceAll``` in the multipool

## Summary

Operators are able to give a swapTarget approval to a multipool's tokens indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an operator rebalances the multipool, the contract approves ```params.amountIn``` tokens to the swapTarget. After the swap, the function only checks that the ```params.amountIn``` value is more than the change in reserve for the token being sent to the swapTarget.

[Multipool.sol#L868-L871](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L868-L871)
```solidity
        uint256 amountIn = params.zeroForOne
            ? reserve0Before - reserve0
            : reserve1Before - reserve1;
        ErrLib.requirement(amountIn <= params.amountIn, ErrLib.ErrorCode.AMOUNT_IN_TO_BIG);
```

This allows the operator to approve swapTarget with a very large amountIn, much larger that actually used in the swap. The swapTarget will then still have the remaining approval to the multipool's tokens after the rebalance is finished.

## Impact

If the swapTarget suffers an exploit that would allow it to spend any tokens approved to it, the multipool could lose all of its tokens.

## Recommendation

Consider setting the approval of swapTarget to 0 at the end of the ```rebalanceAll``` function.
