# Division Before Multiplication in Multipool

## Summary
In Solidity division can result in rounding down errors, hence to minimize any rounding errors we always want toÂ [perform multiplication before division]

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
int24 floorTick = (tick / tickSpacing) * tickSpacing
```
## Impact
Here int24 floorTick can be subject to significant loss of precision due to multiplication occurring after division which can go on to affect the subsequent calculations.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
To prevent this, always perform multiplication before division
