# Attacker can bypass fee accounting and effectively steal all fees from any Multipool contract

## Summary

Attacker is able to steal an excessive amount of fees stored in any Multipool contract by utilizing a flashloan to atomically mint and redeem an excessive amount of underlying LP

## Vulnerability Detail

The logic for determining what percentage of the fees to give a user when calling `withdraw` on the Multipool contract is defined as follows:
```solidity
function withdraw(
	uint256 lpAmount,
	uint256 amount0OutMin,
	uint256 amount1OutMin
) external returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) {
	uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();

	(withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1) = _withdraw(lpAmount, _totalSupply);

	if (lpAmount > 0) {
		withdrawnAmount0 +=
			((IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount0) * lpAmount) /
			_totalSupply;
		withdrawnAmount1 +=
			((IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount1) * lpAmount) /
			_totalSupply;
		...
		_burn(msg.sender, lpAmount);
		_pay(token0, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0);
		_pay(token1, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount1);
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1, lpAmount);
	}
}
```
In particular, a user is given a percentage of the fees which are stored in the contract equivalent to the percentage of the outstanding LP tokens that they control and are withdrawing. This can be seen here, for e.g. token 0:
```solidity
withdrawnAmount0 +=
	((IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount0) * lpAmount) /
	_totalSupply;
```
This implementation allows an attacker to perform the following attack to steal nearly all fees (in one tx):
1. Attacker first takes a flashloan of `token0` and `token1` of any Multipool pool
2. Attacker calls `deposit`, minting themselves an excessive amount of underlying LP tokens (a significant percentage of the outstanding LP tokens)
3. Attacker calls `withdraw`, which will be used to return their underlying tokens, along with sending themselves a majority of the underlying fees
4. Attacker returns the flashloan and keeps the excess fee tokens 
5. The attacker can this replay this attack until they drain their desired amount of fees

There is an attempt to implement logic which would prevent this from happening in the Dispatcher contract. However, a malicious user can simply call `deposit` and `withdraw` on the underlying Multipool contract, which will bypass all fee accounting.

## Impact

Attacker is able to steal an excessive amount of fees stored in any Multipool contract and bypass all fee accounting

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Considering that the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions of the Dispatcher contract handle fee accounting logic, the `withdraw` function of the Multipool contract should not be callable by normal users (only the Dispatcher)
