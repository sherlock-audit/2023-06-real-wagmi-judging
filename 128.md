# Fees accumulated while Multipool tokens are not staked in Dispatcher end up lost

## Summary
Fees accumulated while Multipool tokens are not staked in Dispatcher end up lost

## Vulnerability Detail
Fee growth for tokens deposited in Multipool are tracked for the whole Multipool in vars:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L93

However a user (Alice) cannot withdraw her fees if she keeps her Multipool tokens outside of `Dispatcher`. 
When she decides to deposit her Multipool tokens in the dispatcher, her fee index gets tracked, allowing her to claim fees from multipool from that point on:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L203-L204

But if Alice waits too long before depositing tokens into the Dispatcher, the fees accumulated for her tokens end up lost, and may further break accounting for the `Dispatcher`, as lp tokens withdrawed to service fees are computed using `_totalSupply` for the MultiPool:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L196 

Which means that those fees are not even distributed accross earlier Dispatcher depositors, and are simply lost.

## Impact
Part of Uniswap liquidity gathered fees end up lost for Multipool tokens not deposited into Dispatcher straight away.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This mechanism needs rethinking, either keeping track of fees accumulated for a user directly in Multipool in the same manner as it is done currently in `Dispatcher`, or an easier solution is to create a periphery which deposits in `Multipool` and restakes in `Dispatcher` in the same transaction
