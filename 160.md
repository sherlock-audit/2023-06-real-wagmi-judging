# Flash Loan Attack Vulnerability in `estimateClaim()` Function

## Summary
The `estimateClaim()` function is vulnerable to a flash loan attack due to its reliance on the totalSupply for critical calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the calculations in the function depend solely on the totalSupply of the multipool token. This means that if an attacker executes a flash loan attack and manipulates the totalSupply within a single transaction, it can affect the results of subsequent calculations.

## Impact
By exploiting the flash loan attack vulnerability, an attacker can temporarily manipulate the totalSupply and influence the fee calculations. As a result, the estimated withdrawal amounts (amount0 and amount1) may be inaccurate, potentially leading to financial losses or unfair distribution of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the flash loan attack vulnerability, it is recommended to implement the following measures:

Avoid relying solely on the totalSupply for critical calculations.
Consider implementing safeguards such as comparing the totalSupply before and after the critical calculations to detect potential manipulations.
