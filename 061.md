# should allow users to specify a slippage parameter

## Summary
should allow users to specify a slippage parameter "minTokensOut" minimum amount of output tokens to be received from the swap, such that the swap will revert if it wouldn't return the user-specified minimum amount of output tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 uint256 amount0OutMin = (reserve0 * lpAmount * deviationBP) /
            (_totalSupply * MAX_DEVIATION);
        uint256 amount1OutMin = (reserve1 * lpAmount * deviationBP) /
            (_totalSupply * MAX_DEVIATION);
        (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).withdraw(
            lpAmount,
            amount0OutMin,
            amount1OutMin
        );
```
 no user-specified minimum amount of output tokens, also no check for withdrawnAmount0 and amount0OutMin,  such as 
```solidity
require(withdrawnAmount0 >= amount0OutMin, "less than expected");
```

## Impact
These vulnerabilities can be particularly dangerous in times of high market volatility and can leave the contract open to sandwich attacks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 include a minAmount argument that can be used to revert the transaction if the slippage is too high
