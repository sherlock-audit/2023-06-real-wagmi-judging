# [MED] Multipool#deposit - Minimum amount checks can be bypassed

## Summary
Function `deposit() `in `Multipool.sol` implements `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` checks for desired amounts, but not for minimum amounts. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function implements `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` checks for desired amounts as shown below: 
```solidity

        ErrLib.requirement(
            amount0Desired > MINIMUM_AMOUNT && amount1Desired > MINIMUM_AMOUNT,
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL
        );
```

However, it does not implement the same checks for `amount0Min` and `amount1Min`. Therefore, `function _optimizeAmounts() `can return a value lesser than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT`, and the user can end up supplying liquidity lesser than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT`. 

Let’s look at the function `_optimizeAmounts()` : 

```solidity
            if (amount1Optimal <= amount1Desired) {
                ErrLib.requirement(
                    amount1Optimal >= amount1Min,
                    ErrLib.ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_1_AMOUNT
                );
```

It is checked if `amount1Optimal >= amount1Min`, but since `amount1Min` can be lesser than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT`, `amount1Optimal` can be lesser than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` as well, since no checks for the same have been done. 

The function returns `(amount0, amount1)` as` (amount0Desired, amount1Optimal)` respectively. This means that `amount1Optimal` can be lesser than `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` and `amount0Desired` can be a large value. 

## Impact
The user can get a much lower lp share since `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` checks are not done. Additionally, it is possible to fill up one side of the pool with tokens by setting `amount0Min/amount1Min` to a very low amount, let’s say 0.

                );
```



## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Employ minimum checks for `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` as well in `deposit()` function of `Multipool.sol`.
