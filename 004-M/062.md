# Out of Gas Scenario in the getSlot, setStrategy, _withdraw and getReserves due to Unbounded loop can lead to DOS

## Summary
The functions mentioned above each have an unbounded loop, that also makes multiple external calls to the Uniswap contracts which can lead to DOS.
## Vulnerability Detail
As you could see the functions via the Code Snippet, do not provide a limit to the amount of iteration it should go, With all of the calls and actions happening in the loops of the functions happening in the loop and costing gas it may revert due to exceeding the block size gas limit. when the contract will be in a state where the amount of gas it used will cause its transaction to never be added to a block due to the block gas limit, this will cause a DOS as it will always exceed the available gas limit per block. 
## Impact
There are over multiple actions that the loop has to go through. Halfway through, the execution fails due to exceeding the block size gas limit.
## Code Snippet
- setStrategy ~ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/MultiStrategy.sol#L61C1-L88C10
- getSlots ~ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L592C1-L602C6
- _withdraw ~ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L497C4-L497C44
- getReserves ~ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L704C4-L704C44
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Iteration Limit: Implement a limit on the number of iterations allowed in the loop to prevent potential abuse or excessive computation.
or Consider avoiding all the actions executed in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop.
