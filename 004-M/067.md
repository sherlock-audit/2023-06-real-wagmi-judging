# Unbouned loop can cause denial of service

## Summary
The multiPosition array may become too big and break the deposit and withdraw functionality of the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
_initializeStrategy() wrongly assumes that applying the delete keyword will remove the struct from the array. However, the problem is that the delete keyword only resets items to their default value.

The multiPosition array is used inside the _deposit and _withdraw functions. Therefore, if the array becomes too big, the function may run out of gas and revert.

## Impact
Set severity as high core functionality of the protocol may become unavailable. So users may be unable to withdraw theirs tokens making them locked in the contract forever
