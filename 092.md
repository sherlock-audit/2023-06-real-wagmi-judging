# Liquidity adding in `rebalanceAll` is vulnerable to sandwich attack

## Summary

`rebalanceAll` will add liqudity to uniswap pools. In addition to token swaps, liquidity adding can also be a victim of sandwich attacks.

For a more detailed explanation of the liquidity adding sandwich attack, please refer to this analysis linked: https://eigenphi.substack.com/p/a-brand-new-sandwich-bot-that-could

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by performing the following steps:

1. Front-run with a swap transaction to manipulate the token price in one of the underlying pools and push it out of the strategy range. 
2. `rebalanceAll` will add single sided liquidity to the target pool. This will reduce the back-run swap slippage.
3. Back-run with a reverse swap transaction to profit.

## Impact

The protocol loses money to the attacker.
