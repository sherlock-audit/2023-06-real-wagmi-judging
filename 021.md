# Low level token contract calls can still fail

## Summary
According to the scope of the audit, This was said by the protocol
-Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
-A: USDC,USDT,WBTC,WETH, other wrapped native tokens, and general ERC20 standart with no deflation/inflation model
However, Integration with various token supporting the ERC20 standard contains a wider range of tokens with different core implementations, Some tokens do not return any values so the low level transfer methods in this case could revert or return false for some successful transfers or could succeed for some failed transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
Failed transfers can come from users but the transfer from the protocol would succeed, This can be used to drain the contract and protocol. 
## Impact
```solidity
    function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }

    function _safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 value) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_FROM_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }

    function _safeApprove(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, amount)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_APPROVE_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }
