# Loss of funds due to missing slippage protection

## Summary
When the user deposits assets to the Multipool and withdraw them back immediately, they will suffer from such an unexpected loss of funds. This is probably done due to 2 problems. The second is due to missing slippage protection in the minting function in _deposit function. (The first problem was explained here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi-talfao/issues/2 - Lost of funds of the user due to incorrect lpToken calculation) 

## Vulnerability Detail
The user decides to deposit assets to the Multipool so that he will call the deposit function. But before that, it is good to call estimateDepositAmounts to get the correct number of assets to be put into the pool. After that, the user call the deposit function to deposit assets and withdraw to get his assets back.

The user should get the same amount of tokens as the liquidity providing should be without fee. However, they lose some of his funds.
The tests which well inserted into the original file of tests.
```Javascript
 it("should make a deposit successfully", async () => {
        let usdtAmountToDeposit = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 6);
        let wethAmountToDeposit = await factory.getQuoteAtTick(
            500,
            usdtAmountToDeposit,
            USDT.address,
            WETH.address
        );

        //                        token0 ==weth        token1 ==usdt
        await multipool.connect(manager).deposit(wethAmountToDeposit, usdtAmountToDeposit, 0, 0);

        [usdtAmountToDeposit, wethAmountToDeposit] = await factory.estimateDepositAmounts(
            USDT.address,
            WETH.address,
            usdtAmountToDeposit,
            0
        );
        let BeforeUSDTBalanceOfPool = await USDT.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        let BeforeWETHBalanceOfPool = await WETH.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        console.log("USDT before deposit", BeforeUSDTBalanceOfPool);
        console.log("Weth before deposit", BeforeWETHBalanceOfPool)
        console.log("Alice WETH before deposit", await WETH.balanceOf(alice.address));
        console.log("Alice USDT before deposit", await USDT.balanceOf(alice.address));
        console.log("What Alice deposits", "USDT:", usdtAmountToDeposit, "| WETH:", wethAmountToDeposit);
        await multipool.connect(alice).deposit(wethAmountToDeposit, usdtAmountToDeposit, wethAmountToDeposit, usdtAmountToDeposit);
        let AfterUSDTBalanceOfPool = await USDT.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        let AfterWETHBalanceOfPool = await WETH.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        console.log("USDT After aliceDeposit", AfterUSDTBalanceOfPool);
        console.log("Weth After deposit", AfterWETHBalanceOfPool)
    });

 it("MY TEST Loss of funds after withdraw", async () => {
        let lpBalAlice = await multipool.balanceOf(alice.address);
        console.log("Alice lp tokens", lpBalAlice);

        let estimated = await factory.estimateWithdrawalAmounts(USDT.address, WETH.address, lpBalAlice)
        await multipool.connect(alice).withdraw(lpBalAlice, 0, 0);
        let USDTBalanceOfPool = await USDT.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        let WETHBalanceOfPool = await WETH.balanceOf(multipool.address);
        console.log("USDT after withdraw", USDTBalanceOfPool);
        console.log("WETH after withdraw", WETHBalanceOfPool);
        console.log("Alice USDT after withdraw", await USDT.balanceOf(alice.address));
        console.log("Alice WETH after withdraw", await WETH.balanceOf(alice.address));
        console.log("What are estimated results:",);
    });
```
The original balance of the user Alice was:
```Javascript
Alice WETH before deposit  { value: "100000000000000000000" }
Alice USDT before deposit { value: "10000000000" }
```
```Javascript
The balance after the deposit and withdrawal:
Alice USDT after withdrawing { value: "9999999998" }
Alice WETH after withdrawing { value: "99999999999722195142" }
```
The problem now could occur in the _deposit function. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L385-L390

There is missing slippage protection which can occur during minting. In the callback function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L619-L629), the returned amount should be checked with some minAmmounts, which considers some specific slippage interval.

The good mechanism is explained in the Uniswap source mentioned in the Recommendation section.

### Note
*Note: The loss of funds could also occur in different calculations during the deposit. It would be good to check the whole logic to remediate this loss of funds.* 



## Impact
Due to missing slippage protection, the user can suffer partial loss of funds as he does not influence what is put into the mint call. Even though he specifies some minAmounts when calling the deposit function, the loss persists.
