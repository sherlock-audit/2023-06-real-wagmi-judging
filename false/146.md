# `Factory.sol` never initialize `owner` for Ownable.sol

## Summary
OZ's Ownable.sol now requires the `owner` to be explicitly set rather than assuming `msg.sender` as before. Since the contracts never call the Ownable.sol constructor, `_owner` is never set and is left as address(0). This makes `Factory.sol` completely nonfunctional and disables the critical `createMultipool` function And `add` function in `Dispatcher.sol`.
## Vulnerability Detail

From Ownable.sol

```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner) {
    _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
}
```
The `Ownable.sol` constructor now requires the `owner` to be `explicitly` set rather than always defaulting to `msg.sender`.
## Impact
The `Factory.sol` becomes completely nonfunctional and disables the critical `createMultipool` function and `add` function in `Dispatcher.sol`.
