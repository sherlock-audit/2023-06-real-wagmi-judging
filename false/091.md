# [MED] Multipool#twapDuration Short TWAP Duration Could be subject to manipulation by a malicious validator (FTM)

## Summary

This vulnerability could expose the contract to price manipulation by a malicious validator, particularly in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) environment. 
https://chainsecurity.com/oracle-manipulation-after-merge/

## Vulnerability Detail

The twapDuration in the Multipool.sol contract is set to 150, which is considered too short. Short TWAP durations can allow an attacker who controls the next block to hide information from arbitrageurs, preventing them from rebalancing the market before the manipulation opportunity disappears.

```solidity
uint32 public twapDuration = 150;
```

## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to inaccurate price calculations and potentially result in financial losses for users interacting with the contract. Furthermore, in PoS environments, validators could take advantage of Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) opportunities, leading to unfair advantages and undermining the trust in the system.

## Code Snippet

In the Multipool.sol contract, the twapDuration variable is defined as follows:

```solidity
uint32 public twapDuration = 150;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

consider increasing the twapDuration to make it more difficult for an attacker to manipulate the price. Additionally, ensure that the contract takes MEV into account when designing its mechanisms and assumes competition and equal access to on-chain information for all users.

```solidity
uint32 public twapDuration = 600; // Increase the duration to a more secure value
```
