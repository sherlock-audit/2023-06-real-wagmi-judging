# Missing call to _optimizeAmount() function when rebalancing

## Summary

The `rebalanceAll()` function in a smart contract fails to include the call to the `_optimizeAmounts()` function. This omission can lead to an imbalance in the ratio of token0 to token1 balance. In contrast, the deposit() function in the same contract contains a call to `_optimizeAmounts()`, ensuring the proper ratio balance between `token0` and `token1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `rebalanceAll()` function's purpose is to close all open positions, perform desired token swaps, and open new positions with new strategy settings. However, it does not call the `_optimizeAmounts()` function, which can lead to imbalance in the token ratio. The `_optimizeAmounts()` function calculates the optimal deposit amount for each token to maintain the current ratio in the pool. Without it, the token balances in the `rebalanceAll(`) function may be skewed, leading to potential liquidity issues or unfair distribution of tokens.

On the other hand, the `deposit()` function correctly calls the `_optimizeAmounts()` function, which ensures the token balance ratio is maintained, providing a more stable and fair allocation of tokens.

## Impact

The absence of a call to `_optimizeAmounts()` in the `rebalanceAll()` function could lead to an imbalance between token0 and token1, which could in turn affect the stability of the token pool and introduce unexpected results for liquidity providers. It could also impact the fairness of token distribution, potentially leading to the advantage of some parties over others.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To correct this issue, it is recommended to include a call to the `_optimizeAmounts()` function within the rebalanceAll() function, similar to its inclusion within the deposit() function. This inclusion will ensure the balance ratio between token0 and token1 is maintained during the rebalancing process, leading to a stable and fair distribution of tokens. As always, any changes should be thoroughly tested before implementation to ensure they function as intended and do not introduce any new issues.
