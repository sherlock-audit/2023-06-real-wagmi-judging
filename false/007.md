# Incorrect fee value can be added to the underlyingTrustedPool

## Summary
The _addUnderlyingPool() function does not validate the correctness of the provided fee value before adding it to the underlyingTrustedPools mapping. This will lead to potential issues or unintended behavior.
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker who is able to provide a manipulated or incorrect fee value can potentially exploit the contract's fee calculations or fee distribution mechanisms since any funds sent to the non-existent pool will be irretrievable. This will lead to financial loss 
If a user tries to interact with a pool that doesn't exist or has an invalid fee value, the contract will perform incorrect calculations or transfer funds to a non-existent pool.
## Impact
An incorrect fee value provided during the addition of the underlying pool, will make the contract interact with the wrong pool, leading to potential loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Validate the fee value before adding the underlying pool. Add a check to ensure that the fee value is within the allowed range.
