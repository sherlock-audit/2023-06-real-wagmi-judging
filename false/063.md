# possible lost msg.value

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
the token can be an ERC20 (!= address(0)) or ETH (== address(0)).
When transferring ERC20 tokens, it's crucial to ensure that the user doesn't send msg.value during that transaction. Otherwise, the value they send will be lost.
It's also important to check if the msg.value is equal to the amount when the asset is actually ETH (== address(0))

## Impact
