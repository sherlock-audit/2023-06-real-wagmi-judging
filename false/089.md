# Users might lose their incentives from Multipool when they deposit to Dispatcher contract

## Summary
When depositing or withdrawing from the Dispatcher contract, users will receive their fee rewards from the Multiple pool. However, these fees are reverted to the LP amount based on the current reserves of the Multipool and are withdrawn from the user's shares. This means that users may lose their incentive, as the LP amount they receive might provide more incentives in the future. This is because the collected fees in the Multipool contract will increase over time.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Dispatcher.deposit()` and `Dispatcher.withdraw()` functions collect and transfer the accrued fees of users.
```solidity=
uint256 lpAmount;
{
    (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
    lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);

}
user.shares -= lpAmount;
_withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
```
These fees are converted into LP amounts and withdrawn from the Multipool contract. The corresponding LP amount is deducted from the user's shares, effectively removing it and preventing its claim during withdrawal. However, the LP amount has a higher value than the collected fees due to the Multipool incentives increasing over time as users keep their shares. Consequently, when users withdraw from the Dispatcher contract, they will receive a reduced amount compared to if they had not deposited into the Dispatcher and instead withdrawn directly from the Multipool contract.
## Impact
Users will lose some of their incentives if they deposit into Dispatcher contract.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
`deposit` and `withdraw` functions in Dispatcher contract shouldn't collect fees by converting to LP amounts.
