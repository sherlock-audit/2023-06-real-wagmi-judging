# TwapDuration is too low making it very easy to manipulate

## Summary

A 150 seconds value being used as a TWAP interval is too small

## Vulnerability Detail

The multipool contract includes multiple instances of using twapDuration that introduce potential vulnerabilities and deviate from protocol standards.

## Impact

- A low twapDuration allows attackers to manipulate the TWAP easily.

- Using a twapDuration of 150 seconds obviously does not provide reliable average price representation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a more standard duration for TWAP instead, advisably anything within the range of at least 15 minutes to 30 minutes or above
