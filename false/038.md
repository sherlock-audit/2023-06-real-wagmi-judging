# Defined event Completely omitted

## Summary
An event SetMultipool was defined in the MultiStrategy.sol which is supposed to be emitted anytime the MultiPool is set. However, this event is omitted completely.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity  
 /**
     * @notice function sets corresponding multipool address
     * @param _multipool  address of corresponding multipool
     */
     //@audit setMultipool event not emitted
    function setMultipool(address _multipool) external {
        ErrLib.requirement(multiFactory == msg.sender, ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
        multipool = IMultipool(_multipool);
    }
```
## Impact
Offchain mechanisms and indexers set in place to index events emitted by this contract would never pick up the function
## Code Snippet
-Event is defined here

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
According to the [Sherlock Documentation ](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#list-of-issue-categories-that-are-not-considered-valid) 
-Incorrect Event values:  Incorrectly calculated/wrong values in emitted events are not considered valid medium or high.
However, this event was not emitted at all throughout the contract, So I believe this is a valid medium and should be amended by the team. 
The affected function should be updated to
```solidity
    function setMultipool(address _multipool) external {
        ErrLib.requirement(multiFactory == msg.sender, ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
        multipool = IMultipool(_multipool);
        emit SetMultipool(_multipool);
    }
```
