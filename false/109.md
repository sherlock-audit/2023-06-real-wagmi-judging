# Risk of reentrancy in `deposit()`

## Summary
An external call is made to the deposited token before the user's `feeDebt` variables are updated. In the case where the deposited token relinquishes control to the user, the user will be able to reenter and claim fees before their feeDebt variables are set to the current global fee debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any external call made prior to updating a variable in storage can lead to reentrancy. In this case, the user will be able to claim fees as many times as desired prior to the user's feeDebt being updated to the current global feeDebt.

## Impact
- Reentrancy leading to theft of fees

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L199C1-L204
```solidity
        if (amount > 0) {
            _pay(pool.multipool, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            user.shares += amount;
        }
        user.feeDebt0 = feesGrow.accPerShare0;
        user.feeDebt1 = feesGrow.accPerShare1;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the updating of the user's fees prior to the external call performed via the `_pay` function.
