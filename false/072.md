## Summary
In Multipool.sol, failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In Multipool.sol contract, [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L478-L481),  [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L580-L581),  [uniswapV3MintCallback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L632-L633), [rebalanceAll()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L885) functions has under the hood used below private/internal functions which are given as below,

```Solidity

175    function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) private {
176       (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
177            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
178        );
179        ErrLib.requirement(
180            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
181            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
182        );
183    }
184
185    function _safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 value) private {
186        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
187            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value)
188        );
189        ErrLib.requirement(
190            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
191            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_FROM_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
192        );
193    }
194
195    function _safeApprove(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) private {
196        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
197            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, amount)
198        );
199        ErrLib.requirement(
200            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
201            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_APPROVE_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
202        );
203    }
```

**The main issues is at L-176, L-186 and L-196, It does not check the _address token_ is a contract address  or not. It does not have a validation check for address(0) for _address token_ and such design pattern does not as per recommended solidity guidlines. Because of the above design pattern lots of attacks are already happened. For. example. qubit finance, etc.**

[According to the Solidity documentation:](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)

"The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".

As a result, it is possible that this call() low level function will fail, but _safeTransfer(), _safeTransferFrom, _safeApprove will not notice anything went wrong. In particular, it is possible that the _address token_ is a deleted contract (or say a security bug/flaw was found and selfdestruct was called so that users know to use an updated smart contract), but the above functions will not revert.

If the target address(_address token_) is indeed a non-existent contract, it would be better for above functions to revert. Therefore, considering the above impact including loss of funds, loss of data and in consideration to solidity official documentation. A contract existence check is very much required to prevent the issues.

## References

1) A very similar hack had happened on qubit finance where the helper functions like transferFrom, etc did not check the token address is a address(0) which basically missing of contract existence check. It became a victim to an $80M exploit.

2) Certik analysis of Qubit finance attack confirmed that 

> One of the root causes of the vulnerability was the fact that tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom() does not revert when the tokenAddress is the zero (null) address ([0x0â€¦000](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
2) check _address token_ is not address(0).
3) Alternatively, Recommended to use Openzeppelin [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) in Multipool.sol. [safeERC20 takes care of everything discussed above. ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/cb4bf950df5ae43356c4935b3900446f6dc20261/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L196-L197) and in addition address(0) check will only need to be added.
