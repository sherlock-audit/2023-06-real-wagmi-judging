# LP amount not divisible by decimals

## Summary
- `lpAmount` parameter is divisible by the underlying tokens decimals,  means that an attacker could pass in a `lpAmount` paramete.
## Vulnerability Detail

- The  problem in the `estimateWithdrawalAmounts` function. That  takes in a `lpAmount` parameter, which is the amount of liquidity that the user wants to withdraw, the function does not check if the lpAmount parameter is divisible by the underlying tokens' decimals.  So  an attacker could pass in a `lpAmount` parameter that is not divisible by the decimals, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

- As an example, if the underlying tokens have decimals of `18,` and the attacker passes in a lpAmount of `100,` the function will return a quote that is 100/18, which is not an integer. This would cause the attacker to lose some of their tokens when they withdraw their liquidity.


## Impact
- an attacker could pass in a lpAmount parameter that is not divisible by the decimals, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the estimateWithdrawalAmounts function should check if the lpAmount parameter is divisible by the underlying tokens' decimals. If the lpAmount parameter is not divisible by the decimals, the function should revert with an error message.
