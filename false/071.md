# Multipool.sol - _safeTransfer and _safeTransferFrom could cause a silent failure

## Summary

The custom-made internal functions `_safeTransfer` and `_safeTransferFrom` are not safe and will cause problems with some tokens like USDT that return void on failed transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions `_safeTransfer` and `_safeTransferFrom`  in Multipool.sol use respectively the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 library inside them.
```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }
```
```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 value) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_FROM_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }
```
However the check is insufficient:
`success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool)))`
`success` returns `true` if the call was successful.

For a token that doesn't return value or data on failed transfer(like USDT or some variety of tokens you will use on different chains as well) the 2nd condition  `data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))` will always be true as well due to this expression is always `true`.

Making the check insufficient in catching failed ERC20 transfers.

`_safeTransfer` and `_safeTransferFrom` are used in the `_pay` function:
```solidity
function _pay(address token, address payer, address recipient, uint256 value) private {
        if (value > 0) {
            if (payer == address(this)) {
                _safeTransfer(token, recipient, value);
            } else {
                _safeTransferFrom(token, payer, recipient, value);
            }
        }
    }
```
And the `_pay` function is used on multiple instances in the Multipool.sol contract.

## Impact

This could lead to silent fails and in turn, lead to funds not being transferred, wrongly updated internal balances and disrupted contract logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom from the OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 library, like you did in the Dispatcher.sol contract.
```solidity
function _pay(address token, address payer, address recipient, uint256 value) private {
        if (value > 0) {
            if (payer == address(this)) {
                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, value);
            } else {
                IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value);
            }
        }
    }
```
