# Findings
## [H-1] Users could get same `lpAmountRemoved ` (The estimated number of LP tokens) regardless of user's shares in the pool and the accumulated fees

Beside having different shares in the pool and accumulated fees , users could get same number of corresponding LP tokens .
whenever *((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1)* is odd it will return same number of `shareAmount` as *((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1) -1 *. which is not a good implementation.
Generally for users ,having greater number share should have more claimable LP tokens than users who has less.

I marked this high since staker is in loss of token every time above expression is odd. While just adding some shares to make expression even will make him safe.

## [H-2] Missing Validation *_owner* argument could indefinitely lock owner role

During adding a new multipool in the list of supported pools there is no check for *_owner* argument. Wrong/blank or invalid *_owner* address can lead to further confusion for specific index.

Exploit Scenario

1.  Alice,who is the owner of `_multipool1` ,see the event `AddNewPool(_multipool1)` is triggered. As `_owner` is compromised so now now he is not able to perform any operations that are in controll of `_owner` .

2. As `multipool` has owner role which can be transferred accordong to openzeppelins `Ownable.sol`. but here once `_owner` is added to `poolInfo` array , it can't be updated . which will lead to different owners in `multipool` and `poolInfo[pid]._owner`

## [H-3] Missing Validation *_token0* and *_token1* argument could results in to missing of funds.

Missing validation of `_token0` and `_token1` from the pair token of multipool can lead to loss of funds

< Exploit Scenario>
1.  Alice is waiting for a specific predeployed multipool `_multipool1 ` to be added supported pools. As she got the emited event `AddNewPool(_multipool1)` and he fetched the tokens information from  `poolInfo[pid]` , and she add the liquidity considering that tokens into pool! 
### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Before adding tokens into pool allow a check if tokens are same as in given multipool.

## [L-1] Use `Ownable2Step`'s transfer function rather than `Ownable`'s for transfers of ownership

[Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/3d7a93876a2e5e1d7fe29b5a0e96e222afdc4cfa/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol#L31-L56) and [Ownable2StepUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/25aabd286e002a1526c345c8db259d57bdf0ad28/contracts/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol#L47-L63) prevent the contract ownership from mistakenly being transferred to an address that cannot handle it (e.g. due to a typo in the address), by requiring that the recipient of the owner permissions actively accept via a contract call of its own.

## [G-1]  Avoiding unnecessary params in `_calcFees` 

this will save gas everytime a user call `_calcFees`

for calculating we only need `  growth.accPerShare0` and `  growth.accPerShare1` but we are passing whole struct as memory.

To avoid this we can pass `growth.accPerShare0` and `growth.accPerShare1` directly to save gas

## [G-3]  Division by two should use bit shifting   

This saves computaion gas cost for lpAmountRemoved.
