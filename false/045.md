# The values of block.timestamp & address(this) can be manipulated or predicted to influence the generated salt

## Summary
The approach used to generate the bytes32 salt for contract deployment is not secure for generating random numbers. The salt is generated by concatenating the block.timestamp and address(this). Both block.timestamp and address(this) can be manipulated or predicted by malicious actors.
## Vulnerability Detail
Using block.timestamp as part of the salt introduces a potential vulnerability because miners have control of timestamps they mine. An attacker can manipulate the timestamp to their advantage by predicting the salt and potentially deploy a malicious contract before the intended contract is deployed.
Using address(this) as part of the salt is risky because it is deterministic. If an attacker gains control of the contract's address before deployment, they can deploy a malicious contract with the same address and potentially trick users into interacting with it, leading to a loss of funds or other security risks
## Impact
An attacker can predict the salt value and deploy a contract with the same salt, resulting in a loss of funds or other security vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a reliable source of randomness, such as an oracle or a decentralized random number generator (RNG) service or an external source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF. These services provide a more trustworthy and tamper-resistant source of randomness that cannot be manipulated by miners
