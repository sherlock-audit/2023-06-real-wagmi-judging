# Rounding Errors in estimateClaim Function of the Solidity Contract "Dispatcher"

## Summary

The estimateClaim function of the Solidity contract "Dispatcher" calculates the estimated claimable tokens and LP tokens to be removed from a pool, considering the user's shares in the pool and accumulated fees. The calculation involves a division operation, which may introduce rounding errors.


## Vulnerability Detail
`estimateClaim` uses the user's shares (user.shares) in a particular pool and the accumulated fees to estimate the number of tokens that can be claimed and the corresponding LP tokens that would need to be removed from the pool. In the course of calculating these quantities, the function carries out several division operations, such as `(pendingFee0 * user.shares) / _totalSupply` and `(reserve0 * lpAmountRemoved) / _totalSupply`, where pendingFee0 is the accumulated yet unclaimed fee in `token0`, `reserve0` is the current reserve of `token0`, `lpAmountRemoved` is the estimated number of LP tokens to be removed to withdraw the user's entire share, and `_totalSupply` is the total number of LP tokens in the pool.

Since these operations involve integer division, they can lead to truncation and thus to rounding errors. These rounding errors can, in turn, cause discrepancies between the actual and estimated amounts of tokens that can be claimed and LP tokens that need to be removed from the pool.

```solidity
fee0 += (pendingFee0 * user.shares) / _totalSupply;
fee1 += (pendingFee1 * user.shares) / _totalSupply;
amount0 = (reserve0 * lpAmountRemoved) / _totalSupply;
amount1 = (reserve1 * lpAmountRemoved) / _totalSupply;
```

### POC 
```solidity
User's shares (user.shares) = 2
Total supply of LP tokens (_totalSupply) = 3
Pending fees in token0 (pendingFee0) = 10
The estimate of claimable tokens:
(pendingFee0 * user.shares) / _totalSupply = (10 * 2) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.666...
```

Due to integer division, the result gets rounded down to 6. The actual fraction 6.666... means the user should receive close to 7 tokens, but due to the rounding error, they would only receive 6. This demonstrates a loss due to rounding error.

In a real-world scenario, the numbers involved could be much larger, and these rounding errors, when accumulated over many transactions, can become significant.

## Impact

Underestimation of the amounts of claimable tokens and LP tokens that need to be removed from the pool that lead to loss of funds for users

```solidity
    function estimateClaim(
        uint256 pid,
        address userAddress
    )
        external
        view
        checkPid(pid)
        returns (uint256 lpAmountRemoved, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
    {
        PoolInfo memory pool = poolInfo[pid];
        UserInfo memory user = userInfo[pid][userAddress];
        if (user.shares > 0) {
            IMultipool.FeeGrowth memory feesGrow = IMultipool(pool.multipool)
                .feesGrowthInsideLastX128();
            (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
            (
                uint256 reserve0,
                uint256 reserve1,
                uint256 pendingFee0,
                uint256 pendingFee1
            ) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).getReserves();
            uint256 _totalSupply = IERC20(pool.multipool).totalSupply();
            fee0 += (pendingFee0 * user.shares) / _totalSupply;
            fee1 += (pendingFee1 * user.shares) / _totalSupply;
            lpAmountRemoved = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            amount0 = (reserve0 * lpAmountRemoved) / _totalSupply; //E @audit-issue
            amount1 = (reserve1 * lpAmountRemoved) / _totalSupply; //E @audit-issue
        }
    }
```
