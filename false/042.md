# getDispatcherCode() function  return the creation code of the Dispatcher contract

## Summary
- The getDispatcherCode() function in the DispatcherCode contract returns the creation code of the Dispatcher contract, means that an someone could call the getDispatcherCode() function to get the creation code of the Dispatcher contract, and then use that code to deploy a malicious contract 
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
contract DispatcherCode {
    function getDispatcherCode() external pure returns (bytes memory bytecode) {
        bytecode = type(Dispatcher).creationCode;
    }
}
```

- The getDispatcherCode() function returns the creation code of the Dispatcher contract, which is a reference to the bytecode of the contract. This means that an attacker could call the getDispatcherCode() function to get the creation code of the Dispatcher contract, and then use that code to deploy a malicious contract that has the same bytecode as the Dispatcher contract. This let the attacker to trick users into interacting with the malicious contract, thinking that it is the legitimate Dispatcher contract.
## Impact
-  an attacker can deploy a malicious contract that could steal funds from users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- uses the keccak256() function to hash the bytecode of the Dispatcher contract, and then returns the hash. This prevents an attacker from being able to deploy a malicious contract
