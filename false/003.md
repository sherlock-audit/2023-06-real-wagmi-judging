# XO-`getStrategyAt` function can uses by attackers to trick `users` into thinking that the contract is offering a better deal than it actually is.

## Summary
- The `getStrategyAt` function is vulnerable in the `MultiStrategy` contract may return a default strategy with all parameters set to zero if the index is greater than or equal to the size of the strategies array. This can be exploited by attackers to trick users into thinking that the contract is offering a better deal than it actually is.
## Vulnerability Detail
- so the vulnerability is in the `getStrategyAt` function,
```solidity
function getStrategyAt(uint256 index) external view returns (Strategy memory);
}
```
the vulnerability is  caused by the fact that the function does not check to make sure that the index is less than the size of the strategies array, so an attacker can exploit this vulnerability  to trick users into thinking that the contract is offering a better deal than it actually is.
## Impact
- this vulnerability can allow attackers to defraud users of the contract.

## Recommendation
- change the `getStrategyAt` function to throw an error if the index is greater than or equal to the size of the strategies array.
