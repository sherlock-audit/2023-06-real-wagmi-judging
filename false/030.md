# Dos to rebalancing due to hardcoded slippage.

## Summary
The Multipool.sol slippage is set to 99%, where the amount got from a swap during rebalancing shouldn't be less than 99%of the expected amount, due to the volatility of the prices in the market, the amount gotten from the swap might always(most times) fall below that percentage range.
## Vulnerability Detail
In multipool.sol the maxTwapDeviation is set to 1%,
```solidity 
  uint256 public maxTwapDeviation = 100; // 1%
```
the rebalanceAll function does a check 
```solidity
       ErrLib.requirement(
                (swappedOut * maxTwapDeviation) / MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256 >= swappedOut - amountOut,
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.PRICE_SLIPPAGE_CHECK
            );
        } 
``` 
The requirement statement condition checks whether the calculated slippage, scaled by maxTwapDeviation and MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256, is greater than or equal to the difference between the actual swapped amount (swappedOut) and the expected output amount (amountOut). If the condition evaluates to false, it means that the trade execution has resulted in slippage beyond the allowed limit, and it triggers an error with the PRICE_SLIPPAGE_CHECK error code, and you can see that is has been hardcoded to a tight slippage due to the market volatility of the market the check will always fail because the slippage will always go below 1%.
In summary the Slippage is too tight
## Impact
This causes rebalancing to always fail when called in other to rebalance the pool, and If the rebalance function fails, it may prevent the pool from properly adjusting its holdings or reconfiguring its parameters. This could result in funds being stuck in the pool, unable to be properly allocated or rebalanced. Without proper rebalancing, the pool may struggle to adapt to market conditions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation would be to loosen the slippage a bit maybe to about 2% - 5% where.
```solidity 
  uint256 public maxTwapDeviation = 500; // 5%
```
or input the slippage in the rebalancerParams struct so the person calling the function can set the slippage based on the current market tide
