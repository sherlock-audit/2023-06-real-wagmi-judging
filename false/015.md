# No Restrictions on `setStrategy()` Call Frequency

## Summary

The `setStrategy()` function in the `MultiStrategy` contract has no restrictions on the frequency at which it can be called. This potentially opens up the contract to manipulation by the owner, who can repeatedly set strategies, affecting the pool's allocation and causing potential imbalances or losses for participants.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setStrategy()` function in the `MultiStrategy` contract, which is responsible for updating the current strategies, does not have any restrictions on the frequency at which it can be called. This means that the owner can call this function unlimited times within a short time period. This could potentially allow the owner to manipulate the pool's allocation strategy, leading to unpredicted pool performance and potential losses for pool participants.

## Impact

This vulnerability may lead to significant fluctuations in pool's asset allocation, which might result in potential imbalances or losses for pool participants.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setStrategy(Strategy[] calldata _currentStrategy) external onlyOwner {
    delete currentStrategy;
    // [...]
    currentStrategy.push(_currentStrategy[i]);
    // [...]
    emit SetNewStrategy(_currentStrategy);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to include a restriction or cool-down period between subsequent calls to the `setStrategy()` function. This would prevent the function from being called repeatedly within a short timeframe, reducing the potential risk of pool manipulation.

## Proof Of Concept

The following steps illustrate how to reproduce this issue:

1. Deploy a fork of the mainnet.
2. Deploy the `MultiStrategy` contract.
3. As the owner, call the `setStrategy()` function multiple times within a short time period, each time with a different strategy.
4. Observe the rapid fluctuations in pool allocation as a result of the frequent strategy changes.

These rapid strategy changes might be disruptive to the pool's performance and might cause potential losses to pool participants, illustrating the risks associated with unrestricted frequency of calls to `setStrategy()`.
