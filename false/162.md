# Inconsistent array length pose risks for index-based data access

## Summary

The `poolInfo` and `userInfo` arrays may have different lengths for the same index. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors when accessing and manipulating array elements. The vulnerability can be observed in the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions as well as the `getSlots()` function.
 
## Vulnerability Detail

In the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions, the `poolInfo` and `userInfo` arrays are accessed using the same index `pid`. However, there is no guarantee that these arrays have the same length. This means that accessing corresponding elements may result in out-of-bounds errors or incorrect data retrieval.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability can vary depending on the specific usage of the affected arrays. Inconsistent array lengths can result in accessing invalid memory locations, which can lead to runtime errors, unexpected behavior, and potential crashes. In the case of the `userInfo` array, it may cause incorrect data retrieval or manipulation for specific users, leading to incorrect balances, allowances, or other user-related information.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is necessary to validate the length of the array and handle any discrepancies or inconsistencies before creating the slots array. This can be done by checking the lengths and potentially adjusting the logic to accommodate variations.

Additionally, it is advisable to perform thorough testing and validation of array lengths and their synchronization to identify and resolve any potential issues or inconsistencies.

By ensuring that the arrays share the same index and have consistent lengths, the risk of accessing invalid memory locations, unexpected behavior, and runtime errors can be mitigated.
