# Custom _safeApprove function is vulnerable to frontrunning attacks

## Summary
_safeApprove function is vulnerable to the double-spend attack where a malicious actor detects the function in the mempool and spends his allowance before the update.
## Vulnerability Detail
N/A - described in summary
## Impact
The function is currently used to interact with other tokens. If tokens are presumed to be whitelisted and approved, the contract can be considered safe in its current state. But going forward, any single usage of that function can create a high vulnerability and should therefore be avoided.
