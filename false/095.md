# [MED] unsafe type casting of _param in MultiPoll#setParam() leads to Incorrect Address Assignment

## Summary

In the `setParam()` of the contract, there is a potential casting issue with the `_param` variable. The code attempts to cast _param to address using the expression 

```solidity
operator = address(uint160(_param));
```

However, this casting operation may lead to unexpected behavior or an exception `if _param > uint160.max`


## Vulnerability Detail

The `setParam()` function in the contract contains a vulnerability that can result in an incorrect address assignment. The vulnerability arises when attempting to cast a large value(e.g., `14615016373309029182036848327162830196559325429758`) to `uint160` and subsequently to address. The casting operation assumes that the value of `_param` falls within the valid range for `uint160`, but this assumption is incorrect. 

## Impact

As a result, the contract may assign an unintended and potentially invalid address to the operator variable, compromising the functionality and security of the contract.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L908

```solidity
else if (_managing == MANAGING.OPERATOR) {
            ErrLib.requirement(_param != 0, ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_ADDRESS);
            operator = address(uint160(_param));
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the value of `_param` exceeds the maximum allowed for `uint160`, terminate the transaction or implement appropriate error-handling measures to prevent incorrect address assignment or contract termination. Reverting the transaction with a descriptive error message is recommended.


A [SafeCast Library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#SafeCast) must be used everywhere a typecast is done or

```solidity 

ErrLib.requirement(_param != 0, ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_ADDRESS); 
require(_param <= type(uint160).max, "Value exceeds maximum for uint160"); 
operator = address(uint160(_param));
```
