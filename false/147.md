# Duplicate fee addition in _addUnderlyingPool function

## Summary
The `_addUnderlyingPool` function is responsible for adding a new pool to the `underlyingTrustedPools` mapping. However, it lacks checks to prevent the addition of duplicate fees in the `fees` array. This issue can have adverse effects on future functions that rely on this array, especially if they involve looping through the `fees`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when a new pool is added to the `underlyingTrustedPools` mapping, the corresponding `fee` is appended to the `fees` array without checking for duplicates. Consequently, if the same `fee` value is added multiple times, it will appear multiple times in the array.

## Impact

If future functions utilize the `fees` array and loop through its elements, the presence of duplicate `fees` can lead to inefficiencies. For each duplicate `fee`, the function will perform redundant operations, impacting the overall performance and potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_addUnderlyingPool` function to include a check before appending the `fee` to the `fees` array. This check will ensure that the `fee` being added does not already exist in the array, preventing duplicates.
