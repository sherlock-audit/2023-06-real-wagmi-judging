## Vulnerability Detail

During adding a new multipool in the list of supported pools there is no check for *_owner* argument. Wrong/blank or invalid *_owner* address can lead to further confusion for specific index.

< Exploit Scenario>
1.  Alice,who is the owner of `_multipool1` ,see the event `AddNewPool(_multipool1)` is triggered. As `_owner` is compromised so now now he is not able to perform any operations that are in controll of `_owner` .

2. As `multipool` has owner role which can be transferred accordong to openzeppelins `Ownable.sol`. but here once `_owner` is added to `poolInfo` array , it can't be updated . which will lead to different owners in `multipool` and `poolInfo[pid]._owner`

## Impact

High
