# Creating a Multipool with MAKER tokens will always lead to a revert

## Summary
Multipools with MAKER tokens cannot get created as the transaction will fail upon casting the contract to **`IERC20Metadata`**.

## Vulnerability Detail
Multipools with MAKER tokens cannot get created as the transaction will fail upon casting the contract to **`IERC20Metadata`** because the MAKER token isn't **`IERC20Metadata`** -compatible. Its **`name()`** and **`symbol()`** functions return **`bytes memory`** instead of **`string memory`**, which makes them have different selectors and be incompatible with the standard.

     // @audit the Multipool creation will fail here:
     string memory tokens = string.concat(
        IERC20Metadata(token0).symbol(),
        "/",
        IERC20Metadata(token1).symbol()
     );

## Impact
This effectively makes a very popular token not usable by the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding some sort of a try-catch that doesn't revert the transaction upon a fail.
Another thing that may be considered is to do some external calls with the string-returning selector first, and if it fails call it with the bytes selector and then cast the return value into a string.
