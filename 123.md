# Lack of a Multipool Removal Mechanism in the Dispatcher Contract

## Summary

The Dispatcher Contract lacks a mechanism to remove multipools once they have been added. This could limit the flexibility of managing multipools and potentially expose the contract to prolonged interactions with undesired or malfunctioning multipools.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Dispatcher Contract shown has various functionalities, such as the ability to add multipools, deposit LP tokens, claim fees from LP tokens, and withdraw LP tokens with accumulated fees. However, there is no corresponding remove function for multipools.

Once a multipool is added via the `add()` function, it becomes a part of the `poolInfo[]` array and there is no method present in the contract to remove a multipool from this array. This could be a limitation in cases where a multipool needs to be removed due to various reasons like malfunctioning, undesired behavior, or simply a need for updating the list of multipools.

## Impact

The inability to remove a multipool could lead to several potential issues:

Reduced Flexibility: The contract owner can't manage the multipools in a flexible manner. Once a multipool is added, it becomes a permanent part of the contract unless the entire contract is redeployed.

Exposure to Malfunctioning Pools: If a multipool starts malfunctioning or shows undesired behavior, the contract does not provide a direct method to cease interaction with it.

Difficulty in Updating Pools: As crypto-market dynamics evolve, some multipools might become less desirable or even obsolete. The lack of a removal function makes the process of updating the multipools in the contract challenging.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to address this issue, the following changes could be made to the contract:

Implement a Remove Function: A remove function could be added to the contract to allow the contract owner to remove a multipool from the `poolInfo[]` array. This would allow for better management of the multipools and reduce the risks associated with malfunctioning or obsolete multipools.

Reordering the Array: When implementing a remove function, one might consider handling "gaps" in the array that occur after a removal. This could be done by moving the last element of the array to the removed element's position and then decreasing the array's length.
