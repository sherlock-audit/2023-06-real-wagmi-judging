# Dispatcher.poolInfo can lead to confusions

## Summary
Dispatcher.poolInfo can lead to confusions
## Vulnerability Detail
In Dispatcher.sol doesn't have any method to remove/change `poolInfo` array. Moreover, `PoolInfo` struct have an variable named `owner` which actually can change owner in `Multipool.sol` using `transferOwnership()`
## Impact
Because `poolInfo` is a public variable, it will be confusing if protocol owner call `Dispatcher.add` through `Factory.createMultipool()` with incorrect inputs and can't redo it
Moreover, when Multipool contract can change owner by calling `Multipool.transferOwnership()`, but `Dispatcher.poolInfo[x].owner` is not change will confuse the user
