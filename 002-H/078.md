# DoS - No Rebalance possible if there is no underlying Pool with Fee 500

## Summary

If there is no trustedPool with fee set to 500 all usages of getAmountOut will revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Multipool.sol:823](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L823) the `getAmountOut` function always takes the pooladdress from the stored `underlyingTrustedPool` with fee `500`. However, it is nowhere ensured, that there is a underyling Pool with that fee.
If there is no pool with that fee, the poolAddress will be  `address(0)` and the call to `observe` will revert.
`getAmountOut` is also used in `rebalanceAll`, which will prevent the rebalance from working, too.

## Impact

If there is no Pool with Fee 500:
- all calls to `getAmountOut` will revert
- no rebalance is possible

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not hardcode the usage of Fee 500 Pool for getting the pool address.

Instead you could just use the first fee and the corresponding underlying pool

```solidity
 IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[fees[0]].poolAddress)
 ```
