# The `getAmountOut` function in Multipool contract might be permanently unactive or manipulated with low liquidity pools

## Summary
In the Multipool contract, the getAmountOut function always uses the underlying pools with a constant fee of 500. This approach may lead to this function being permanent inactive or being manipulated with low liquidity pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
`getAmountOut` function is triggered to get the expect swapped amount and do the safe check of swap result in `rebalanceAll` function.
However, this function uses the pool with a constant fee (500).
```solidity=
(int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[500].poolAddress)
        .observe(secondsAgo);
```
If the current underlying factory does not have a 500-fee pool, or the pool has not been added previously, this function will revert and prevent the execution of the rebalanceAll function.

Furthermore, it is undesirable for this pool to remain unchangeable. In the future, the pool may experience low liquidity, which could make it susceptible to manipulation. This would result in incorrect price calculations and pose a risk for the safe check of swap operations.
## Impact
`rebalanceAll` function might be unable to execute or might use the unsafe amount to check the swap result.

Manual review

## Recommendation
A mechanism should be implemented to allow for the selection of the pool used to obtain the price in the `getAmountOut` function.
