# Wagmi assumes only one UniV3 pool exists for a pair of tokens



## Summary

Uniswap allows for numerous pools to exist for the same token pair as long as they have different fee levels. For certain pairs (e.g. pools with 1% fee for stablecoins) some pools may exist, but have very little liquidity. This can make price manipulation very cheap , even if TWAP is used
Now the `_addUnderlyingPool` function allows for adding and selecting different pools based on the fee for a given pair of tokens. However, this could be an issue since Uniswap V3 pools with different fees can exist for the same pair of tokens, note that whenever an attempt is made to add a new pool this line reverts the execution

```solidity
        revert InvalidFee(_fee);
```

But the fact that different pools for same tokens with different fees is not taken into account, and if 2 pools exist for a pair of tokens and one has more liquidity than the other then only the one with more liquidity should be integrated with protocol to ensure stability.

## Impact

integrating a more error prone pool to protocol

## Tool used

Eyes review

## Recommendation

The concept of different pools for the same token should be accounted for and a measure should be taken to ensure that only the right pool is registered for a pair of tokens
