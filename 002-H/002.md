# Rebalance functionality may revert in some pools that do not support 0.05% fee tier. (or provide non-robust pricing)

## Summary
Rebalance functionality may revert in some pools that do not support 0.05% fee tier. (or provide non-robust pricing due to low liquidity)

## Vulnerability Detail
- `rebalanceAll` function relies on the `getAmountOut` function, which then tries to query twap from the 0.05% fee tier pool. However, not all pairs support 0.05% fee tier -- in some cases, the 0.05% might not be the biggest liquidity. For example, USDT-USDC pair.
- Also, the current implementation relies on the fact that the 0.05% fee tier will have deep enough liquidity as time goes. However, this may not be the case if new fee tier pool emerges and liquidity shifts e.g. to a 0.01% fee tier pool.

## Impact
`rebalanceAll` will revert, causing the rebalance functionality to revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make the 0.05% fee tier custom e.g. create a mapping where the best fee tier can be assigned from the contract owner and can be updated accordingly.
- Or ensure the listed pool has 0.05% fee tier as the major pool.
