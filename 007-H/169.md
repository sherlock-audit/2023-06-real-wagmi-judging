# Multipool.sol: No fee would be collected when calling the `function earn() external`

## Summary

Since the inner function [_earn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L239) takes the first argument 'lpAmount' as zero, inside the `_withdraw` there will not be any fee updates.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the comments indicates , the fee would be collected and updated while calling the earn function.

     * @notice This function collects fees from the liquidity pool and updates the fee growth inside both Vaults per share
     *         based on the amount of fees collected. It then returns the updated fee growth values.
     * @dev When called, this function updates the fee growth inside each Vault according to the realised fees in the current block,
     *      adding them to the `feesGrowthInsideLastX128` struct member variable of the contract.
     */

But, the first argument would be key to decide the valid amount of `lpAmount` at [Line505](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L505-L506).

Since the lpAmount is set as zero, the calculation at above mentioned line would result the value of `liquidityToWithdraw` as zero.

So, there will not be any liquidity amount to burn and update the fee value in the following lines of codes.

                (, , , uint128 tokensOwed0Before, uint128 tokensOwed1Before) = IUniswapV3Pool(
                    position.poolAddress
                ).positions(position.positionKey);


                (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).burn(
                    position.lowerTick,
                    position.upperTick,
                    liquidityToWithdraw
                );


                withdrawnAmount0 += amount0;
                withdrawnAmount1 += amount1;


                (, , , uint128 tokensOwed0After, uint128 tokensOwed1After) = IUniswapV3Pool(
                    position.poolAddress
                ).positions(position.positionKey);


                fee0 += (tokensOwed0After - amount0) - tokensOwed0Before;
                fee1 += (tokensOwed1After - amount1) - tokensOwed1Before; 


## Impact

There will not be any fee updates which is mentioned as per the natsec comments.
The dev intention is not fulfilled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If fee want to be updated while calling the earn function, pass the first argument as 1 when calling _withdraw inside the _earn function.
    function _earn(uint256 _totalSupply) private {
        if (_totalSupply > 0) {
            _withdraw(0, _totalSupply);     ---------------->> pass the first arg as 1
        }
    }
