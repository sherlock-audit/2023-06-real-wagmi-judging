# Attacker can prevent any fees from going to admin by front-running calls to `deposit` and `withdraw`

## Summary

A malicious user is able to prevent any fees from going to the admin by minting a small amount of LP to the Multipool contract prior to calling `deposit` or `withdraw`, which will mess up the internal accounting used to determine the amount of fees to mint the admin.

## Vulnerability Detail

To determine the growth in fees for a given LP position in the Multipool contract, in both the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions, the logic first determines the `tokensOwed0Before` and `tokensOwed1Before` for the position. Then it performs the action on the Uniswap V3 pool: either `burn` or `mint`. Then it again calculates the `tokensOwed0After` and `tokensOwed1After` values, taking the difference between these (minus e.g. removed liquidity) to be the growth in fees. Let's take the `_deposit` function as an example:
```solidity
...
if (liquidity > 0) {
	(, , , uint128 tokensOwed0Before, uint128 tokensOwed1Before) = IUniswapV3Pool(
		position.poolAddress
	).positions(position.positionKey);

	IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).mint(
		address(this), //recipient
		position.lowerTick,
		position.upperTick,
		liquidity,
		abi.encode(position.poolFeeAmt)
	);

	(, , , uint128 tokensOwed0After, uint128 tokensOwed1After) = IUniswapV3Pool(
		position.poolAddress
	).positions(position.positionKey);

	fee0 += tokensOwed0After - tokensOwed0Before;
	fee1 += tokensOwed1After - tokensOwed1Before;

	IUniswapV3Pool(position.poolAddress).collect(
		address(this),
		position.lowerTick,
		position.upperTick,
		type(uint128).max,
		type(uint128).max
	);
}
...

```
The difference between the `tokensOwed0After` and `tokensOwed0Before` values after performing the `mint` call is set to be the change in fees. These values are then used in the `_upFeesGrowth` function to determine the amount of fees which are minted to the admin:
```solidity
if (_totalSupply > 0) {
	_upFeesGrowth(fee0, fee1, _totalSupply);
}
```
And in the `_upFeesGrowth` function:
```solidity
function _upFeesGrowth(uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1, uint256 _totalSupply) private {
	...
	uint256 feeGrowthWeight = MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256 - protocolFeeWeight;
	uint256 fee0WPF = (fee0 * feeGrowthWeight) / MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256;
	uint256 fee1WPF = (fee1 * feeGrowthWeight) / MAX_WEIGHT_UINT256;
	...
	_pay(token0, address(this), owner(), fee0 - fee0WPF);
	_pay(token1, address(this), owner(), fee1 - fee1WPF);
}
```
The issue with this logic is that even though the `collect` function call in the `_deposit` function will always gather all the fees for a given position, the `fee0` and `fee1` values can be gamed to be 0, meaning the admin will never get any fees. 

To perform this attack, a malicious user will front-run calls to `deposit` and `withdraw` with a call to `mint` on the relevant Uniswap V3 pool(s), with the recipient set to that Multipool address. This will update the `tokensOwed0Before` and `tokensOwed1Before` values such that they will be equal to `tokensOwed0After` and `tokensOwed1After`, resulting in the recorded `fee0` and `fee1` amounts being 0. The call to `collect` will still send all the tokens to the contract, meaning stakers can take an excess amount of fees, bypassing the fees intended for the admin. This will also mess up internal accounting of fees, breaking the functionality of the Dispatcher contract.

## Impact

Malicious user can prevent admin from receiving fees, which in turn will break internal accounting of fee debt and break the functionality of the Dispatcher contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculations for `fee0` and `fee1` should not be defined as the difference between e.g. `tokensOwed0After` and `tokensOwed0Before`. Rather, since the call to `collect` will take all available owed tokens, `fee0` should simply be `tokensOwed0After` and `fee1` should be `tokensOwed1After`.
