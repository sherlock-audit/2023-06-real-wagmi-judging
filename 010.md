# Wrong `floorTick` calculation in `_getTicksForPosition()`

## Summary

Wrong `floorTick` calculation in `_getTicksForPosition()` because we have division before multiplication loss of precision

## Vulnerability Detail

 `_getTicksForPosition()`  function calculates the lower and upper ticks for a position in a Uniswap V3 pool. When we calculate `floorTick` we have loss of precision:
 
 ```solidity
 int24 floorTick = (tick / tickSpacing) * tickSpacing;
```

- For example now if `tick = 7` and `tickSpacing = 3`, the `floorTick` is 2.33333 which is 2 because the fractional part gets truncated.

Now the same example but with multiplication before division:
```solidity
int24 floorTick = (tick * tickSpacing) / tickSpacing;
```

- If `tick = 7` and `tickSpacing = 3`, the `floorTick` is 3.

## Impact

Loss of precision and `floorTick` result can be wrong

## Recommendation

Change `floorTick` calculation to:

```solidity
int24 floorTick = (tick * tickSpacing) / tickSpacing;
```
