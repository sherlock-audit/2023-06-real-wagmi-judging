# Price Slippage Issue in `withdraw()` Function of `Multipool.sol`

## Summary

The `withdraw()` function could potentially be manipulated by an attacker under certain market conditions to withdraw more than their fair share of funds from the pool, which may cause an imbalance in the underlying pool and potential loss to other pool participants.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `withdraw()` function in the `Multipool.sol` contract allows a user to withdraw a specified amount of liquidity from the pool. The function calculates the amount to be withdrawn based on the total supply of liquidity in the pool and the amount requested by the user.

However, this calculation does not account for price slippage in the underlying Uniswap pool. As a result, if there is a significant price movement between when the withdrawal request is initiated and when it is executed, the user could potentially withdraw more than their fair share of the pool's funds. 

This vulnerability is present due to a lack of appropriate slippage check in the `withdraw()` function.

## Impact

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker under certain market conditions, specifically if they can manipulate significant price movement in the underlying Uniswap pool, leading to potential loss for other pool participants.

## Code Snippet

The following is the relevant part of the `withdraw()` function in the `Multipool.sol` contract:
```solidity
  function withdraw(
  uint256 lpAmount,
  uint256 amount0OutMin,
  uint256 amount1OutMin
  ) external returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) {
  uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();

  (withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1) = _withdraw(lpAmount, _totalSupply);

  if (lpAmount > 0) {
  withdrawnAmount0 +=
  ((IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount0) * lpAmount) /
  _totalSupply;
  withdrawnAmount1 +=
  ((IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount1) * lpAmount) /
  _totalSupply;

  ErrLib.requirement(
  withdrawnAmount0 >= amount0OutMin && withdrawnAmount1 >= amount1OutMin,
  ErrLib.ErrorCode.PRICE_SLIPPAGE_CHECK
  );

  _burn(msg.sender, lpAmount);
  _pay(token0, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0);
  _pay(token1, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount1);
  emit Withdraw(msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1, lpAmount);
  }
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a slippage check before the final withdrawal to ensure that the amount to be withdrawn does not exceed a certain threshold above the user's proportional share of the pool. This can be done by comparing the amount to be withdrawn to the user's share of the pool (based on their LP tokens) multiplied by the current price of the pool's assets.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Set up a testnet forked from the mainnet using Ganache.
2. Deploy the Multipool contract on the testnet with sufficient liquidity.
3. Simulate a significant price movement in the underlying Uniswap pool by trading large amounts of the pool's assets.
4. Call the `withdraw()` function on the Multipool contract with a high `lpAmount` value.
5. Observe that the user is able to withdraw more than their fair share of the pool's funds.
6. Verify that the pool's balance is less than it should be, indicating a loss to other pool participants.
