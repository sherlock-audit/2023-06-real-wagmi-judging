# Unsafe downcast cause overflow that could lead to incorrect calculation of SqrtPriceX96.

## Summary
The tickCumulatives array gotten from IUniswapV3Pool.observe is used to calculate avarageTick which in turn is used to calculate the sqrtPriceX96, the tickCumulatives int56 is cast to a lower type int24, but this casting is performed without first checking that the values being cast can fit into the lower type. As a result, there is a risk of a silent overflow occurring during the casting process.
## Vulnerability Detail
in the getAmountOut function it calculate the the sqrtPriceX86 using the average tick.
```solidity 
(int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(underlyingTrustedPools[500].poolAddress)
            .observe(secondsAgo);
            // @audit unsafe downcast int56 to int24 can lead to silent overflow where the averageTick will be less causing incoorrect calculation in the calculation of the sqrtPrice 
        int24 avarageTick = int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int32(twapDuration)); // rounding issues de here sha.
        // @audit sqrtPriceX96 is calculate via 
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(avarageTick);
```
And the averageTick is gotten using the tickCumulatives whose values are in value type int56, but in order to caculate the averageTick its value is cast to Int24, and if the value is above type(int24).max it will cause a silent overflow making the tickCumulative to be less than what it is.
## Impact
Remember the sqrtPriceX96 is used to calculate the amount out. This, in turn, would result in a totally incorrect price calculation, causing potential financial losses for users or pool owners.

## Recommendation
Add checks that the casting value is not greater or less than int24 the  type max value:
