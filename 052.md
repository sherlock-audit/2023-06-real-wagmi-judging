# Divergence between different DEXs when rebalancing will miss-calculate slippage

## Summary
Divergence between different DEXs when rebalancing will miss-calculate slippage 

## Vulnerability Detail

When rebalancing, real wagmi does use one of their whitelisted contracts (aggregators). As said by the team, 1inch it would be an example of one.

The problem here, is that the actual swapping for rebalancing and the calculation of the `amounOut` is made in different DEXs/aggregators.

- Swapping:

- amountOut: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L823
 Specially, as deploying in so many chains it will diverge between the DEX pool where you swap and the DEX where you calculate the `amountOut` The `amounOut` in exchange X for `token1` will be be completely different to the `amounOut` in exchange Y for `token1`, because it depends on the reserves in the actual pool.

## Impact
Error on calculating slippage through different DEXs that will cause losing funds due to missing an accurate slippage

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do calculate the slippage from the same DEX where it was swapped
