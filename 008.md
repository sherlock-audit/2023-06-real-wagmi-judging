# the Factory and the Dispatcher contracts will be left without an owner

## Summary

The `Dispatcher` and `Factory` contracts in the codebase assume that the deployer of the contract is automatically set as the owner by default. However, this assumption is no longer accurate in the recent version (v4.9.0) of `OpenZeppelin`. In the updated version, the owner must be explicitly included as a constructor argument to properly initialize the contract owner. Failing to initialize the owner explicitly leaves the contract without an owner, which renders key functions inoperable.
 
See:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6ddacdbde856e203e222e3adc461dccce0c2930b/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L36-L41
## Vulnerability Detail
In the latest version (v4.9.0) of `OpenZeppelin`, it is necessary to explicitly initialize the owner of a contract, unlike in previous versions where the contract deployer was automatically set as the owner by default. If the owner is not initialized properly, the contract will be left without an owner, which can have adverse consequences.
```solidity
     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.
     */
    constructor(address initialOwner) {
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }


```

Dispatcher and Factory contracts will be left without an owner, leaving the functions [`Dispatcher.add`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Dispatcher.sol#L55) and [`Factory.createMultipool` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/82a234a5c2c1fc1921c63265a9349b71d84675c4/concentrator/contracts/Factory.sol#L76)inoperable
## Impact
Contract will be without an owner, making this key functions inoperable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


Consider updating the constructor in the `Factory` contract and adding a constructor in the `Dispatcher` contract.

```solidity
    constructor(address initialOwner) Ownable(initialOwner) {
        
        ##########
    }
```

Or simply add an additional owner address parameter in the constructor, then _transferOwnership(initialOwner); on deployment
