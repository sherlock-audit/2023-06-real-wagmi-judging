# While Swapping One Token To Other via `getAmountOut()` Token Decimals Difference Are Not Taken To Consideration

## Summary
Tokens Decimal Difference Should taken into consideration.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here simply 
. First `sqrtPriceX96` get
. Then according to its value its `Square` calculated
. Then Multiplied with `amountIn` and Divided by `1 << 192` [This change according to situation, i'm considering first one]

But there is a issue here that token with different decimals not adjusted here

For simplicity let consider `USDC/ETH pool`
```solidity
Price of ETH in term of USDC will = 1/P * 10**12
where P = (sqrtPrice/Q96)**2
where Q96 = 2**96
```

If we consider Below swapping code corresponding to above math equation,
`P` Calculation is satisfied But Decimal adjust is not

In above equation 10**12 simply exists because of Decimal difference between ETH and USDC

So code should implement this decimal adjustment case, As Protocol Readme Specify it supports `USDC,USDT,WBTC,WETH, other wrapped native tokens, and general ERC20 standart with no deflation/inflation model`

```solidity
............
............
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(avarageTick);
        if (sqrtPriceX96 <= type(uint128).max) {
            uint256 ratioX192 = uint256(sqrtPriceX96) * sqrtPriceX96;
            swappedOut = zeroForOne
                ? FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX192, amountIn, 1 << 192) // @audit-issue decimal not adjusted here
                : FullMath.mulDiv(1 << 192, amountIn, ratioX192);
```
## Impact
Swapping Amount will inaccurate
