# User withdrawals will fail if they try to withdraw slightly less than all their shares

## Summary
User withdrawals will fail if they try to withdraw slightly less than all their shares

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can withdraw their positions via `withdraw` and specify the amount of shares they want to withdraw. If a user specifies less shares than all the ones he owns (wants to not withdraw everything at once), it enters the following code:

```@solidity
 } else if (amount < user.shares) {
            uint256 lpAmount;
            {
                (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
                lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            }
            user.shares -= lpAmount;
            _withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
        }
```
Let's put the example that user(Bob) has 10 shares and wants to withdraw 9 shares.

If the calculation of the `lpAmount ` is more than 1, let's say 2 for the example : 
`  lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);`

then the withdrawal will fail because, it first substracts the `lpAmount` to the users whole shares ` user.shares ` have been updated to 8.

After the calculation, they are substracting again `sharesRemoved` to the ` user.shares ` which is currently 8.

```@solidity
uint256 sharesRemoved = amount > user.shares ? user.shares : amount;
 user.shares -= sharesRemoved;
```

As the amount specified was smaller than the actual owned shares, `sharesRemoved ` will be `amount`, which it is 9 shares.

Finally on the substraction: ` user.shares -= sharesRemoved`, it will fail due to an underflow. `user.shares` = 8 and `sharesRemoved` = 9

10 shares - 2 = 8 shares. Now, users shares
