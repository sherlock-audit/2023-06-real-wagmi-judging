# lower amount if share amount gotten via the _estimateWithdrawalLp

## Summary
The _estimateWithdrawalLp which determines the share Amount of a given user is suspectable to a serious loss of precision and will return for users less amount of lpAmount  when making calculations in certain functions which can be exploited and also can cause loss to users
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see below is the implementation of the _estimateWithdrawalLp function

    function _estimateWithdrawalLp(
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1,
        uint256 _totalSupply,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1
    ) private pure returns (uint256 shareAmount) {
        shareAmount =
            ((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1) /
            2;
    }

As you can see the share amount it should return, performs operations that would lead to a huge loss of percision or potential rounding to zero, and this function is used to calculated the lpAmount of a user in certain pools
               lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            }
            user.shares -= lpAmount;
            _withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
        }


   _pay(pool.multipool, address(this), msg.sender, sharesRemoved);
The same goes for the deposit function, And as you can see it performs the withdrawFee and _pay function using that amount gotten from the _estimateWithdrawalLp function which returns less amount of shares for a user when performing such operations.
## Impact
This will cause users to get very less shares than they are supposed when depositing, less fees gained and less for when the are also withdrawing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow the multiplication before division rule, scale up the share amount by a certain factor, and also implement a require statement to ensure the value isn't rounded to zero.
