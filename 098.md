# Users proportionate share of fees are sent `twice`.

## Summary
During the withdrawal process starting from the `Dispatcher.sol` contract after the user's share of fees is calculated, it is sent to the user in the `Multipool.withdraw` and then sent again in `Dispatcher._withdrawFee`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets follow the withdrawal process, a user calls `Dispatcher.withdraw` 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, uint256 deviationBP) external checkPid(pid) {
        PoolInfo memory pool = poolInfo[pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[pid][msg.sender];
        (
            uint256 reserve0,
            uint256 reserve1,
            IMultipool.FeeGrowth memory feesGrow,
            uint256 _totalSupply
        ) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).snapshot();

        require(user.shares > 0, "user.shares is 0");
        require(_totalSupply > 0, "sharesTotal is 0");
        if (amount > user.shares) {
            // withdraw witout claiming
            amount = user.shares;
        } else if (amount < user.shares) {
            uint256 lpAmount;
            {
                (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = _calcFees(feesGrow, user);
                lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
            }
            user.shares -= lpAmount;
            _withdrawFee(pool, lpAmount, reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, deviationBP);
        }
 // More Code....
}
```

After some checks `Dispatcher.withdraw` calls the internal function `_withdrawFee` 
```solidity

    function _withdrawFee(
        PoolInfo memory pool,
        uint256 lpAmount,
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1,
        uint256 _totalSupply,
        uint256 deviationBP
    ) private {
        uint256 amount0OutMin = (reserve0 * lpAmount * deviationBP) /
            (_totalSupply * MAX_DEVIATION);
        uint256 amount1OutMin = (reserve1 * lpAmount * deviationBP) /
            (_totalSupply * MAX_DEVIATION);
        (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) = IMultipool(pool.multipool).withdraw(
            lpAmount,
            amount0OutMin,
            amount1OutMin
        );
        _pay(pool.token0, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0);
        _pay(pool.token1, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount1);
    }

```


This function calculates the `minamountout` for the two tokens then calls `Multipool.withdraw`
```solidity
 function withdraw(
        uint256 lpAmount,
        uint256 amount0OutMin,
        uint256 amount1OutMin
    ) external returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount0, uint256 withdrawnAmount1) {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();

        (withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1) = _withdraw(lpAmount, _totalSupply);

        if (lpAmount > 0) {
            withdrawnAmount0 +=
                ((IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount0) * lpAmount) /
                _totalSupply;
            withdrawnAmount1 +=
                ((IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)) - withdrawnAmount1) * lpAmount) /
                _totalSupply;

            ErrLib.requirement(
                withdrawnAmount0 >= amount0OutMin && withdrawnAmount1 >= amount1OutMin,
                ErrLib.ErrorCode.PRICE_SLIPPAGE_CHECK
            );

            _burn(msg.sender, lpAmount);
            _pay(token0, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0);
            _pay(token1, address(this), msg.sender, withdrawnAmount1);
            emit Withdraw(msg.sender, withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1, lpAmount);
        }
    }

```
This function further calls its internal function `Multipool._withdraw` which returns  (withdrawnAmount0, withdrawnAmount1) then after burning the `ipamount` of `msg.sender` sends the fee amount.

The issue here is that when the call to `Multipool.withdraw` is done, `Dispatcher._withdrawFee` sends the same amount to the `msg.sender` again.

## Impact
This leads to a loss of funds from the protocol as users get double the amount they are supposed to receive.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
User's share of fees should only be sent once. So the _pay functions call in `Dispatcher._withdrawFee` should be removed.
