# Incorrect Implementation of the checkPID modifier could lead to DOS

## Summary
The checkPid modifier that checks if a pool id is less than the poolInfo.length wasn't implemented correctly and will cause dos to users trying to interact with particular pool they invested in.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Pid is the id of the pool the user invested in and it contains the info of the pool via the index in the poolInfo variable, however, to check if a pool  is supported it makes use of the checkPid modifier which is implemented as follows
```solidity
    modifier checkPid(uint256 pid) {
        require(pid < poolInfo.length, "invalid pid");
        _;
    }
```
the pid which is the id of the pool to query is checked like this, which is wrong because the poolInfo is an array with several indexes storing structs of PoolInfo, and the first index of an array is counted starting from 0 for its indexes, but the pid starts from 1 being the ID of a pool to query, this means that to access the last element of the array you'll go like this poolInfo.length + 1 meaning the check would fail if a user wants to interact with the last element add to the poolInfo because the pid of that pool with be above the poolInfo.length
## Impact
This will cause a DOS to the user trying to interact with the last pool added to added, because the checkPid modifier will revert on checking the pid of the pool. Note: the checkPid modifier is used on the deposit, estimateClaim, and The withdraw function. meaning users won't be able to deposit, withdraw or claim for this pool in the Dispatcher.sol

## Recommendation
```solidity
    modifier checkPid(uint256 pid) {
        require(pid <= poolInfo.length + 1, "invalid pid");
        _;
    }
```
