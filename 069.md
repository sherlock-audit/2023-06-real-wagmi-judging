# Multipool.sol - _safeTransfer and _safeTransferFrom are not safe

## Summary
The custom-made internal functions _safeTransfer and _safeTransferFrom are not safe and will cause problems with some tokens that return void on failed transfer, like USDT.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the code of _safeTransfer:
```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) private {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
        );
        ErrLib.requirement(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.ERC20_TRANSFER_DID_NOT_SUCCEED
        );
    }
``` 
The code for _safeTransferFrom is identical.
As you can see, the function calls the standard ERC20 `transfer` function and then performs a check whether the transfer succeeded. 

However, the check is insufficient:
`success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool)))`
`success` returns `true` if the call was successful. 

However, for a token that doesn't return value or data on failed transfer(like USDT, or some other variety of tokens you'll use on different chains as well) the 2nd condition `data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool)` will always be true as well due to this expression `data.length == 0` is always true.

Making the check insufficient in catching failed ERC20 transfers.

_safeTransfer and _safeTransferFrom are used in the _pay function which in turn is used on multiple instances in the contract.
## Impact
This could lead to silent fails and in turn, lead to funds not being transferred, wrongly updated internal balances, and disrupted contract logic, depending if future functionality will be built using these functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20, like you did in the Dispatcher.sol contract.
