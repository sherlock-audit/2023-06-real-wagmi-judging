# Broken check and logic with different ERC20 token decimals

## Summary

Malfunctioning Code with Variable Token Decimals

## Vulnerability Details

It has been established through various evidence that the functionality of the existing code is compromised when dealing with tokens having different decimal values. The majority of ERC20 tokens operate on 18 decimals, but there are exceptions. For instance, NEAR uses 24 decimals, USDC works with 6 decimals, and WBTC employs 8 decimals.

In light of these variations, the hard-coded constant:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MINIMUM_AMOUNT = 1000_000;
```

fails to cater to all token decimal configurations. The minimum amount of 10 ** 6 can translate to 0.01 BTC, 1 USDC, or an insignificant worth of ETH or other tokens. As a result, the following checks prove ineffective:

```solidity
ErrLib.requirement(
	amount0Desired > MINIMUM_AMOUNT && amount1Desired > MINIMUM_AMOUNT,
	ErrLib.ErrorCode.AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL
);
```

## Impact

The presence of such an error leads to malfunctioning logic whenever a token with different decimal values is involved.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L74).

## Tool used

This vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, we recommend the dynamic scaling of the `MINIMUM_AMOUNT` value based on the decimal points of the respective token.
