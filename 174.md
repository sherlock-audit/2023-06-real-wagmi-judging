# Using Spot Liquidity for LP Minting

## Summary
The code snippet provided demonstrates a vulnerability related to using spot liquidity to determine the minted LP (Liquidity Provider) amount in a smart contract. This vulnerability allows for potential manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable code snippet is part of a function that handles deposits and involves the calculation of reserve amounts (`reserve0` and `reserve1`) for tokens `token0` and `token1`. The snippet is as follows:

```solidity
// @audit
// user slippage not respected
slots = getSlots();

(uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, , ) = _getReserves(slots);
(amount0Desired, amount1Desired) = _optimizeAmounts(
	amount0Desired,
	amount1Desired,
	amount0Min,
	amount1Min,
	reserve0,
	reserve1
);
// MINIMUM

uint256 l0 = (amount0Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve0;
uint256 l1 = (amount1Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve1;
lpAmount = l0 < l1 ? l0 : l1;
```

In the code, `reserve0` and `reserve1` are retrieved from the on-chain state by calling the `balanceOf()` function on the `token0` and `token1` contracts respectively. These reserve amounts are then used in calculations to determine the minted LP amount (`lpAmount`).

The vulnerability arises from the fact that sending tokens directly to the pool can manipulate the `reserve0` and `reserve1` values, resulting in the minting of a larger LP amount. Malicious actors can exploit this behavior to manipulate the liquidity and potentially disrupt the functioning of the contract.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that the minted LP amount can be manipulated, compromising the integrity of the contract. This manipulation can lead to imbalances in liquidity, potential loss of funds, and disruption of the expected behavior of the system.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerable code snippet can be found at the following GitHub location:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L700](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi/blob/main/concentrator/contracts/Multipool.sol#L700)

## Tool used
Manual review was performed to identify this vulnerability.


## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to track the reserve amounts using a variable that is not influenced by external token transfers. By utilizing a separate variable for tracking reserves, the contract can maintain accurate reserve values that are not subject to manipulation. This ensures the integrity of the LP minting process.

It is important to note that this vulnerability was identified through manual review. A comprehensive security audit should be conducted to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities present in the contract.
