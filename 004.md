# The add() function doesn't check if the pool already exists. Duplicate pools can be added

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function add(
    address _owner,
    address _multipool,
    address _strategy,
    address _token0,
    address _token1
) external onlyOwner {
    PoolInfo memory pInfo = PoolInfo({
        owner: _owner,
        multipool: _multipool,
        strategy: _strategy,
        token0: _token0,
        token1: _token1
    });

    poolInfo.push(pInfo);
    emit AddNewPool(_multipool);
}
```

In this function, there is no mechanism to prevent the addition of a pool that has the same properties (owner, multipool, strategy, token0, and token1) as an existing pool. The function simply creates a new PoolInfo struct and pushes it to the poolInfo array. As such, even if an identical pool already exists in the poolInfo array, the function will still add the new (duplicate) pool.

## Impact
It can cause confusion and can lead to errors in pool management. For example, if a user tries to interact with a pool and uses the pool index to identify the pool, they could accidentally interact with the wrong pool if duplicates exist.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check can be added to the add() function to ensure that a pool with the same properties does not already exist in the poolInfo array.
