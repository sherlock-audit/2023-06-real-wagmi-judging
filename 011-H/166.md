# Divergence in calculating lp amounts will cause an imbalance depositing and withdrawing

## Summary
Divergence in calculating lp amounts will cause an imbalance depositing and withdrawing 

## Vulnerability Detail

The interaction between the multipool contract and the dispacher to withdraw and deposit the lp tokens from the pool contract has a faulty logic that causes the wrong amount of lp tokens being subtracted from the users balance.

To send their lp tokens to the dispacher, users have to first deposit independently in the multipool. The calculation of the lp tokens that they receive is as follows: 

They multiply the amounts by the total supply and divide by the reserves of each token, then the lp amount of tokens minted, will be  the smaller of both

```@solidity
         uint256 l0 = (amount0Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve0; 
           uint256 l1 = (amount1Desired * _totalSupply) / reserve1; 
           lpAmount = l0 < l1 ? l0 : l1;

---------------------------------
_mint(msg.sender, lpAmount);
```

Once a user deposits on the lp tokens on the dispacher, the calculation of the lp tokens to burn, it is different to the one from the multipool. causing an error in the accounting:

```@solidity
lpAmount = _estimateWithdrawalLp(reserve0, reserve1, _totalSupply, fee0, fee1);
function _estimateWithdrawalLp(
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1,
        uint256 _totalSupply,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1
    ) private pure returns (uint256 shareAmount) {
  shareAmount =
            ((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1) / 2;
}
```
multiplying both supplies by the amounts, dividing by their reserves, and dividing by 2.

Therefore, you will mint the smallest amount of both calculations of lp tokens and you will burn the average amount of both calculations.

## Impact

Loss of lp tokens due to an error accounting for their amounts in between dispacher and multipool

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the exact same calculation to determine the shares to mint/burn and substract the users
