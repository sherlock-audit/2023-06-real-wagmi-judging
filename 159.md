## Vulnerability Detail
## [H-1] Users could get same `lpAmountRemoved ` (The estimated number of LP tokens) regardless of user's shares in the pool and the accumulated fees

Beside having different shares in the pool and accumulated fees , users could get same number of corresponding LP tokens .
whenever *((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1)* is odd it will return same number of `shareAmount` as *((amount0 * _totalSupply) / reserve0 + (amount1 * _totalSupply) / reserve1) -1 *. which is not a good implementation.
Generally for users ,having greater number share should have more claimable LP tokens than users who has less.

I marked this high since staker is in loss of token every time above expression is odd. While just adding some shares to make expression even will make him safe.
