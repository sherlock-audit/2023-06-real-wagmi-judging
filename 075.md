# Price calculation using `slot0` is susceptible to flashloan exploits

## Summary

Price calculation using `slot0` is susceptible to flashloan exploits

## Vulnerability Detail

Multipool's `getSlots` and `_initializeStrategy` uses the uniswap v3 pool `slot0` to fetch number of tokens it has in it's position. `slot0` is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate with flash loans.

```js
File: Multipool.sol
272:     function _initializeStrategy() private returns (Slot0Data[] memory) {
...
279:         Slot0Data[] memory slots = new Slot0Data[](positionsNum);
280:
281:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < positionsNum; ) {
...
287:             (slots[i].currentSqrtRatioX96, slots[i].tick, , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(
288:                 uPool.poolAddress
289:             ).slot0();
...
309:         }
310:         return slots;
311:     }
...
589:     function getSlots() public view returns (Slot0Data[] memory) {
590:         uint256 posNum = multiPosition.length;
591:         Slot0Data[] memory slots = new Slot0Data[](posNum);
592:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < posNum; ) {
593:             PositionInfo memory position = multiPosition[i];
594:             (slots[i].currentSqrtRatioX96, slots[i].tick, , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(
595:                 position.poolAddress
596:             ).slot0();
597:             unchecked {
598:                 ++i;
599:             }
600:         }
601:         return slots;
602:     }
```

This vulnerability in the `getSlots` function poses a risk to various actions, including the `deposit()` and `snapshot()` functions, which utilize this data.

Furthermore, the `_initializeStrategy` function, which is called during the initial `deposit()` and `rebalanceAll()` processes, is also affected by this issue. Manipulation of the `slot0` value can lead to inaccurate calculations and potentially exploit the Multipool.

Attacker can use flashloan to borrow some asset and inject the pool, and due to `slot0` behavior, this flashloan can easy manipulate the price (LP) pool. Then he can do whatever he want like sandwich-ing, etc, from the affected functions described before.

## Impact

Price / LP values can be manipulate to cause loss of funds for the protocol and other users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using a TWAP oracle to get the price instead of relying on `slot0`.
